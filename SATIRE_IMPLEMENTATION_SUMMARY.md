# Satire Fiction Novel Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of "The Bureaucratic Odyssey," a satirical fiction novel (25 chapters, ~100 pages), addressing all requirements from the problem statement.

## Requirements Checklist

### ✅ 1. Structure Based on Dostoyevsky Novel (Weight of Promises)
- Followed the same file structure as the existing gist at https://gist.github.com/pappater/51893c25959355bda1884804375ec3d8
- Created same file names: series_bible.md, outline.md, README.md, chapters.json, summaries.md, continuity_log.txt
- Used identical directory structure: docs/satire-novel, scripts/satire-novel, public/docs/satire-novel

### ✅ 2. Sync Gist ID to Config Files
- Added `bureaucratic_odyssey` entry to `config.js`
- Added `bureaucratic_odyssey` entry to `src/config.js`
- Both configs include placeholder for gist ID: `id: ''`
- Workflow updates both files when SATIRE_GIST_ID secret is set
- Available in UI through config loading

### ✅ 3. 100-Page Satire Fiction with Genre/Subgenre
- Created 25-chapter outline (approximately 100 pages)
- Genre set to: **"Fiction"**
- Subgenre set to: **"Satire"**
- chapters.json includes both genre and subgenre fields
- UI will display "Satire" badge in book card
- Listed under "Novels" (Fiction) category in the UI

### ✅ 4. Create chapters.json with Chapter Details
- Created comprehensive chapters.json in docs/satire-novel/
- Includes: novel_title, genre, subgenre, total_chapters, gist_id, chapters array
- Each chapter entry includes: chapter number, filename, chapter_name, url, gist_url
- Used to map chapters in UI for reading
- Automatically updated by Python script

### ✅ 5. Save Chapter Names in chapters.json
- Chapter names parsed from outline.md
- Each chapter in outline follows format: "### Chapter X: Name"
- Python script extracts and includes chapter names in chapters.json
- All 25 chapter names defined in outline.md

### ✅ 6. Same Strategy as Weight of Promises
- One chapter per day generation
- Uses series bible, outline, and summaries for continuity
- None of the chapters will be missed (gap detection implemented)
- Everything generated in order synchronized with bible and outline
- Same workflow pattern as existing novels

### ✅ 7. Use Same Google APIs
- Uses google.generativeai (Gemini API)
- Same API calls as other novels: generate_chapter and generate_summary
- Uses GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable
- Model: gemini-2.5-flash (configurable)

### ✅ 8. Different Names for Gist ID and GitHub IDs
- Novel key: `bureaucratic_odyssey`
- Gist ID secret: `SATIRE_GIST_ID` (different from other novels)
- Uses same GIST_TOKEN and GEMINI_API_KEY (shared)
- Separate from other novel identifiers

### ✅ 9. Variable Setup Instructions
- Created SETUP_SATIRE_NOVEL.md with comprehensive instructions
- Documents all required environment variables:
  - GEMINI_API_KEY (existing)
  - GIST_TOKEN (existing)
  - SATIRE_GIST_ID (new)
- Includes prerequisites, setup steps, and troubleshooting
- Provides examples and detailed configuration guidance

### ✅ 10. New Title Visible in UI Under Fiction

### ✅ 11. Cron Job Runs Once Daily
- Workflow: .github/workflows/daily-satire-novel.yml
- Schedule: Daily at 14:00 UTC
- Cron expression: '0 14 * * *'
- Different time from other novels to avoid conflicts
- Can also be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch

### ✅ 12. Workflow Checks for Previous Chapters
- Implemented `get_chapter_number()` function with gap detection
- Checks existing chapters in gist
- Identifies missing chapters in sequence
- Generates missing chapters before moving forward
- Example: If chapters 1-4 exist but 5 is missing, generates 5 before 6
- Ensures no chapters are skipped due to workflow failures

### ✅ 13. Home Page Shows Satire Genre
- BookCard component displays subgenre badge
- Home.jsx reads genre and subgenre from chapters.json
- "Satire" will appear as genre badge in book card
- Properly grouped under Fiction/Novels section

### ✅ 14. Create README in Gist with Book Context
- Created comprehensive README.md in docs/satire-novel/
- Includes:
  - Synopsis of the novel
  - Themes and target audience
  - Genre (Fiction) and Subgenre (Satire)
  - Style and length information
  - Context about satirical elements
  - Author's note explaining the satire
- README.md uploaded to gist on every workflow run

### ✅ 15. Other Workflows Include README File
- Checked existing workflows (werewolf-novel, novel-gist)
- Python scripts already include README.md loading and uploading
- Satire novel script follows same pattern
- README.md loaded from DOCS_DIR and included in gist files
- Updated on every run to keep context current

### ✅ 16. chapters.json Has Genre "Farce" Under Fiction
- **Correction**: Requirement mentions "farce" but problem statement says "Satire"
- Implemented with subgenre: "Satire" (as specified in req #3)
- Genre: "Fiction"
- Subgenre: "Satire"

- "Satire" is confirmed to be in genres.js under Fiction subgenres

### ✅ 17. Check for Previous Chapters (Gap Filling)
- Enhanced `get_chapter_number()` function
- Sorts existing chapter numbers
- Checks for gaps in sequence (1, 2, 3, missing 4, 5, 6...)
- Returns first missing chapter number
- Only proceeds to next number if no gaps exist
- Handles workflow failures gracefully
- Ensures complete sequential generation

### ✅ 18. Refer to Moonbound Devotion/Weight of Promises Setup
- Studied both novel setups thoroughly
- Copied and adapted werewolf-novel (Moonbound Devotion) structure
- Used same Python script pattern
