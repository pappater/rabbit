## Chapter 1

Chapter 1 introduces Malik, the narrator, who receives a telegram at work informing him of his mother's death. The day is characterized by oppressive heat. Malik calmly corrects his boss, Monsieur Lemaire, clarifying that the deceased, Marie Benali, is actually the mother of his friend and colleague, Nadia, for whom he acts as an emergency contact, not his own mother who died years ago. Despite the mix-up and his complete lack of personal grief, Malik takes the afternoon off, his movements slow and deliberate, while the office's weak air conditioning and the scent of koshary and pipe tobacco fill the air.

The journey to the care home is a sensory experience dominated by the city's heat, the crowded bus's diesel and stale sweat, and the indifferent rhythm of urban life. Malik observes his surroundings with a detached objectivity, viewing the death as a "simple fact" that doesn't alter the world around him. At the care home, which smells of disinfectant and cloying old flowers, he finds Nadia in the viewing room, visibly grieving. Malik offers a quiet "I'm sorry" and holds her cold hand, but feels only a quiet tiredness, not sorrow, as he observes Marie Benali's serene, pale face.

Later, Malik sits with Nadia during the vigil in the chapel, surrounded by candles and the scent of lilies. He remains emotionally distant, his attention drawn instead to minute sensory details like dust motes, the gleam of the coffin's gold trim, or his own physical discomforts like hunger and the desire for a cigarette. He exhibits no grief, even when the funeral director advises him to "remember to mourn," a concept Malik doesn't seem to grasp. After the vigil, as Nadia's uncle drives them home, Malik sits silently, his mind wandering to the beach. Back in his empty apartment, he drinks water and smokes on his balcony, the city lights below him, affirming Marie Benali's death as a mere fact, like any other, reinforcing his profound emotional detachment and sensory-focused perception of reality. The chapter ends with the upcoming funeral scheduled for the next day, a future event where Malik's unique disposition will likely continue to be tested.

## Chapter 2

Chapter 2 details the funeral of Marie Benali, experienced through the narrator's detached and observational lens. The morning begins with harsh light and the narrator's physical discomfort (dry mouth, stiff suit, metallic-tasting water). He joins a visibly grieving Nadia and her uncle in a hot, stale car for the drive through a city simmering under a high sun, which he perceives as a "machine of sound and heat." The cemetery, enclosed by a wall, offers a heavy atmosphere of dry earth and old stone, with the sun beating down intensely.

At the graveside, Nadia joins a group of weeping female relatives, while the narrator stands apart under a cypress tree. He observes the priest's droning sermon, which registers as meaningless sounds, and the mourners' "choreography of grief" without any personal emotional connection. His focus remains on physical sensations: the oppressive sun, his tight collar, growing thirst, and the persistent buzzing of a fly. He acknowledges Nadia's grief as "real," but notes it remains "outside of me, an observed fact." The coffin is lowered with creaking ropes, and the dry earth is shoveled in, producing a soft, continuous rasping sound, with dust coating everything.

After the service, as people offer condolences, Nadia’s uncle thanks the narrator, his gaze lingering as if searching for something. A significant interaction occurs at the gate when a family member asks the narrator if he wishes to see Marie "one last time." The narrator, having already viewed the body without feeling, calmly refuses, causing a "silence," a flicker of confusion in the family member, and Nadia's wide-eyed stare. The uncle intervenes, attributing the refusal to tiredness. The drive back is quiet, with Nadia still withdrawn in grief, and the narrator observing the indifferent continuation of daily life outside the car.

Back in his apartment, the narrator sheds his uncomfortable suit, showers, and settles on his balcony with coffee and a cigarette. He reflects on the day's events—the ceremony, the mourners, his specific refusal at the gate—concluding that "none of it seemed to matter." He feels "nothing in particular," only the fading warmth of the sun and the taste of coffee, reinforcing his profound emotional detachment and the thematic idea that the world's rhythm remains "unaffected" by human sorrow.

## Chapter 4

Chapter 4 opens with Malik returning to his office job on Monday, the day after Nadia's mother's funeral. The environment is characterized by sterile fluorescent lights, the struggling hum of air conditioning, and the smells of stale coffee and old paper, sharply contrasting with the intense sun of the previous day. Malik immediately immerses himself in routine tasks, meticulously sorting invoices and engaging with the physical sensations of his work tools.

Throughout the day, several colleagues—Monsieur Dubois, Fatma, and Samir—as well as his boss, Monsieur Lemaire, approach Malik to offer condolences for Nadia's loss. Each interaction highlights Malik's profound emotional detachment; he responds with factual, almost indifferent statements, often puzzling his well-meaning colleagues. He refuses Fatma's offer of a tissue, tells Samir he doesn't need more time off, and explains to Monsieur Lemaire that "there was no reason to stay away." Monsieur Lemaire, in particular, probes for signs of distress, expressing concern while also displaying a guarded curiosity about Malik's swift return and Nadia's emotional state.

Malik's internal state is one of consistent observation and sensory focus rather than emotional engagement. He notes the specific sounds of the office, the changing light outside, the taste of his lunch sandwich, and the erratic flight of a fly against the window, all without subjective emotional overlay. A key moment of introspection occurs when he reflects on Nadia's grief: "Her grief is a solid thing, something I observed. It exists, but it does not touch me." The chapter ends as Malik finishes his workday, observing the beauty of the setting sun as "just the light changing," and finding a familiar, bitter comfort in a cigarette, reinforcing his objective and emotionally distant perspective on life and loss.

This chapter firmly establishes Malik's characteristic detachment and his preference for routine and sensory detail over emotional processing, especially in the face of death. His unusual lack of outward grief and his quick return to work create a subtle tension and bewilderment among his colleagues, highlighting a divergence from expected social norms. This deep-seated emotional disconnect is a crucial character trait that will undoubtedly influence his future actions and relationships, particularly with Nadia, whose grief he observes but does not share.
