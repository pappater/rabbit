## Themes

1. **The Absurdity of Social Climbing**: The ridiculous lengths people go to for status and recognition
2. **Appearance vs. Reality**: The gap between how people present themselves and who they really are
3. **The Corruption of Ambition**: How desire for success can make people compromise their values
4. **Class Pretension**: The arbitrary nature of social hierarchies
5. **Identity and Authenticity**: Finding oneself amidst pressure to conform
6. **The Price of Deception**: How lies and schemes inevitably spiral out of control

## Tone

- **Fast-paced** with rapid-fire dialogue and overlapping conversations
- **Physically comedic** with slapstick moments and visual gags
- **Satirical** in its treatment of social ambition and pretension
- **Increasingly chaotic** as complications pile up
- **Ultimately redemptive** without being sentimental

## Comedy Style

- **Mistaken Identity**: Characters being confused for others or deliberately impersonating someone
- **Verbal Misunderstanding**: Taking things literally, mishearing, malapropisms
- **Physical Comedy**: Pratfalls, collisions, comedic props and costumes
- **Dramatic Irony**: Audience knows things characters don't
- **Escalating Complications**: Each solution creates new problems
- **Rapid Entrances/Exits**: Characters appearing at the worst possible moments

## World Rules

1. Everyone is obsessed with status and appearance
2. The social club operates by arcane, absurd rules
3. Coincidences happen at the worst possible times
4. Secrets are impossible to keep but easy to misunderstand
5. Physical spaces are designed for maximum comedic potential (doors that open at wrong moments, hiding places that fail, etc.)
6. Technology (phones, intercoms) always malfunctions at critical moments
7. The more characters try to maintain dignity, the more ridiculous they become
