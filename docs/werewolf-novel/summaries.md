## Chapter 1

The chapter opens with Lyra's village under a brutal werewolf attack. Awakened by screams and the scent of woodsmoke, Lyra attempts to protect her best friend Elena and the two young children, Elara and another, from the invading "wolves that walked on two legs." The hut door is violently splintered, revealing a hulking werewolf, and then the Alpha King, Kael Nightshade, a human-formed leader wielding an axe, gives the chilling command to "Take the able-bodied. Kill the rest." Despite Lyra's desperate resistance, she is forcefully separated from Elara and Elena and dragged out into the blazing chaos of her dying village.

Amidst the carnage, Lyra is propelled toward the center of the square where she sees the formidable Alpha King Kael Nightshade, observing the destruction with chilling composure. In that instant, their gazes lock, and a powerful, electric jolt of recognition—a fated mate bond—shatters Lyra's terror, filling her with a terrifying, inexplicable awareness. Kael feels this primal connection as a physical blow, his disciplined wolf raging to claim and protect her, despite his human duty screaming against a human queen. Struggling to conceal the chaos she ignites within him, Kael curtly orders all captives, explicitly including Lyra, to be taken "intact" to his castle, his eyes briefly flicking back to her with an unspoken command to survive.

Lyra and the other surviving villagers, including a terrified Elena, are then forced on an arduous march through the night, leaving their burning village behind. The journey through the forest is a blur of fear and exhaustion, with werewolves of various forms surrounding them, highlighting the alien and dangerous nature of their world. As dawn approaches, they arrive at the imposing, iron-reinforced stone fortress of the Silverclaw Kingdom, a clear sign there will be no escape.

Finally, Lyra is led into a grand, torch-lit hall within the castle, where she again feels the magnetic pull. There, seated on an ornate throne, is Kael Nightshade, his golden eyes already fixed on her. The electric awareness between them is even stronger, a silent, primal acknowledgment passing between human captive and monstrous king. With a veiled hint of frustration, Kael gives a cold command to "accommodate" the new arrivals, his eyes never leaving Lyra. Captured and brought to the heart of her enemy's domain, Lyra feels a terrifying certainty that her fate is now inextricably bound to the Alpha King.
