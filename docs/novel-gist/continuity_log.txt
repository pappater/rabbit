--- Chapter 1 (2025-11-03 03:02:56 UTC) ---
Dmitri Ivanovich Volkov, a former military officer, finds himself financially destitute and burdened by the chaotic affairs of his recently deceased father, Ivan Fyodorovich. Three months after his father's death, Dmitri struggles to manage their neglected apartment and provide for his younger sister, Katya, while grappling with the labyrinth of his father's imprudent business dealings.

While sorting through his father's study, Dmitri discovers an old, iron-bound strongbox. Upon forcing it open, he finds a leather-bound ledger and a sealed letter from his father. The letter reveals Ivan Fyodorovich’s "deathbed promise," entrusting Dmitri with a "burden of the spirit"—a moral imperative to right the wrongs and extend mercy to those whose lives were negatively impacted by his father's past misjudgments. Ivan emphasizes this as a "debt of the soul," urging Dmitri to mend what he had broken.

The ledger then lays bare the crushing reality of this task, listing numerous individuals and families, such as Anna Sergeyevna Orlova, a widow in poverty, along with significant debts and accounts of shattered livelihoods. Overwhelmed by the astronomical sums and the profound moral obligation, Dmitri feels a wave of resentment mixed with despair. He grapples with the impossible choice between his inherited honor and his own penury, recognizing that fulfilling this sacred promise threatens to consume his future and Katya's well-being. The chapter concludes with Dmitri contemplating the first name in the ledger, setting the stage for his arduous journey to confront his father's past and atone for his mistakes.
