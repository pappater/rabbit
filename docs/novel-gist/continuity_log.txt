--- Chapter 1 (2025-11-03 03:02:56 UTC) ---
Dmitri Ivanovich Volkov, a former military officer, finds himself financially destitute and burdened by the chaotic affairs of his recently deceased father, Ivan Fyodorovich. Three months after his father's death, Dmitri struggles to manage their neglected apartment and provide for his younger sister, Katya, while grappling with the labyrinth of his father's imprudent business dealings.

While sorting through his father's study, Dmitri discovers an old, iron-bound strongbox. Upon forcing it open, he finds a leather-bound ledger and a sealed letter from his father. The letter reveals Ivan Fyodorovich’s "deathbed promise," entrusting Dmitri with a "burden of the spirit"—a moral imperative to right the wrongs and extend mercy to those whose lives were negatively impacted by his father's past misjudgments. Ivan emphasizes this as a "debt of the soul," urging Dmitri to mend what he had broken.

The ledger then lays bare the crushing reality of this task, listing numerous individuals and families, such as Anna Sergeyevna Orlova, a widow in poverty, along with significant debts and accounts of shattered livelihoods. Overwhelmed by the astronomical sums and the profound moral obligation, Dmitri feels a wave of resentment mixed with despair. He grapples with the impossible choice between his inherited honor and his own penury, recognizing that fulfilling this sacred promise threatens to consume his future and Katya's well-being. The chapter concludes with Dmitri contemplating the first name in the ledger, setting the stage for his arduous journey to confront his father's past and atone for his mistakes.


--- Chapter 2 (2025-11-03 03:15:35 UTC) ---
Six days after discovering his late father Ivan Ilyich’s ledger and a letter confessing "profound wrongdoings," Dmitri Volkov is tormented by the "sacred obligation" to atone for these "moral debts." Despite his own destitution and inner turmoil, he meticulously prepares to confront Anna Sergeyevna Orlova, the first name on the list. His father's marginalia indicated Ivan Ilyich's "carelessness" and "lack of scruple" led to Pyotr Orlov's financial ruin and early death.

Arriving at Anna's modest home, Dmitri struggles to articulate his impossible mission. He finds Anna, older and marked by hardship, but possessing enduring dignity. After a hesitant invitation, Dmitri confesses his father's schemes, specifically how his "disastrous advice" regarding timber contracts led to Pyotr's financial and spiritual ruin, contributing to his death. Anna initially defends her husband's death as illness but confirms his trust in Ivan Ilyich and the subsequent devastation, accusing Ivan Ilyich's "carelessness" of breaking her husband's spirit.

Dmitri explains his deathbed vow to his father to seek "true recompense"—not necessarily monetary, but through honest reckoning and atonement. Anna, initially resentful and prideful, gradually recognizes Dmitri's own torment, noting, "you are as much a prisoner of your father's past as I am." The tone shifts from dread and accusation to a fragile, shared empathy. Dmitri, though still uncertain of the path, commits to his "sacred task," promising to keep Anna informed. This unexpected alliance marks the beginning of Dmitri's arduous journey, highlighting that atonement involves not only confrontation but also complex, shared human connection.
