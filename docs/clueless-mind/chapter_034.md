The little shop
at the corner filled the space with dust, cigarette smoke, and sipping tea. The atmosphere is
golden yellow from the evening sun, hot, and smelling of spicy snacks. There was a queue of
auto rickshaws without a driver as everyone was having their break at the tea stall, smoking.
Few from the museum, after seeing all the old stuff, searching for the driver. The driver saw
them searching and did nothing as they wanted a little happiness in making those people search,
and as per their expectation, the people were searching urgently and lost their cool and started
to worry as if their life was about to end. The drama was broken when one of the drivers
announced that he would ride them.
There was a wine shop nearby the tea stall. The remaining drivers were just waiting for time to
pass, to get done for the day, and to get drunk. They smoked for some time and saw that the
time was not gone too much. They went back to the rickshaw stand. Watching people, a young
man bought a newspaper from the stall. One of the drivers stopped him and informed him that
a 30 page book was free along with the paper and told him to ask the vendor. Fella replied and
got his book. Still, there is more time left to get the day done. The golden ray was just fading,
and it was dark enough to get drunk. They changed their uniforms and headed to the wine shop.
It is crowded. The four got four quarters of liquor. Next to the wine shop is the snack bar,
where they get a bite to go with their drink. Potato chips, pickles, water, peanuts, and other
stuff.
Next to the snack bar is a dark, abandoned shop where no one goes during the day but where
people can drink comfortably. They formed a circle on the ground, prepared their set up,
cheered them on, and it went for four rounds. The final round without mixing went directly to
the body to hit them high. They started their conversation. Each began to tell their story; none
cared; some urged for more to drink; some smoked; some ate; and one fella simply exited and
snored on the floor. The task of three is to take the dozed-off fella home. They tried and failed
in the middle, where the auto just stopped near the graveyard. The three got out and were
checking, and it was dead dark that no one was there to help them. They were unstable. One of
the fellas from that three was afraid of this ghost and stuff, and upon coming to know that they
were standing near the graveyard, he got scared and joined the dozed off fella, and he too dozed
off. The two were doing something to fix it. They failed. They joined the dozed-off fella,
planning to sleep in the auto itself. Some on the ground as there was not enough space for all
four to doze off together.
