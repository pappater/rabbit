It is said that if you have anus, don’t laugh at neighbours fart. It is an African proverb. I always
admire the African way. They were straight to the point in simple terms. Just like the Chinese or
Japanese way. Not sure from where I came to the conclusion. The truth may be different, but
with the information and prejudice I had on them, from the inputs of browsing and stuff, this is
what it felt, that they were straight to the point and simple in terms.
I remember those stuff from Things Fall Apart. It was a short read and told how the
colonisation just ruined the tribal stuff and its root and its branch.
The day was dull. The intention was to sleep till 12 in the afternoon, but got up around 10 and
was struggling between taking rest or to do the work. Connected to work post lunch and
nothing much was there to do today. Cleaned the room and wrote some todos and stacked them
on the wall in front of the study table.
Yesterday was my sister's wedding. It was fun for her but not for me. The concept of reception
on the day before the wedding event is one of the worst things that I came across recently. It is
just a pre wedding photoshoot with people and relatives. And for that, a bunch of money was
spent and nothing made sense at all. Maybe some people get excited from it, but it is surely not
for me stuff. And the marriage too went smoothly. No it was not. It was a mixed marriage and it
was kept secret from long distance relatives. But when the marriage ceremony is about to
happen, the iyer echo the names of the bride and grooms parents name with the caste and
boom, all that was kept as a secret blasted and the stunned people were unspoken and blunt and
dull and confused and the doubt that was there inside them, now resulted to be true and they
were excited about their finding as well as the shockness it just impacted. And I was the one
among the happiest people out there. That it got revealed easily without any effort or energy.
And I liked the caste system for the first time ever in my life. I was happy.
We went home, slept nicely and returned back to the wedding hall. We met the next marriage
gang and we joined them and had our lunch. The butter milk saved the afternoon.
