The pain is
in the left ear, and that gives the left a headache and it also, the consciousness, confuses me to
ask, maybe because of a wisdom tooth ? And as it keeps on asking the question, the pain gets
intensified and keeps on focusing on it and eventually the pain occupies ¾ of the ache. The
remaining ¼ urges to be creative. Urges to draw, to play keys, to write and stuff. But the ¾ is
intermittently reminded that being creative is so tiresome and further intensifies the pain and it
was what had become, the 4/4 for instant creativity. It now urges to take rest, on achieving 4/4.
To shut eyes and rest. But even after the consciousness instruction, the pain gets 5/4 and
troubles with the pain more and more, that at one time, it feels to keep the head out of the body.
And upon the newer thought root, the pain slightly reduced and into the urge to improvise on
the new thought. Radio-Head ? What if it was a goat head ? Or Horse head ? and so on. If at all,
the body has the cat head, survival is not a big deal and it can be managed and that was the sole
purpose and would skip the unnecessary question of who am I ? What is the purpose of this and
that stuff? And the reasoning too got involved, that with humans head but in a cat head
consciousness. It is thinking nothing is what the cat's head is about. Would become a cat. With
whiskers and stuff. With routine and seeking people by mesmerising them and ruling them. In
Fact cats are indirectly ruling humans. If at all, a cat.
