Book Survive.
It was for those people who were uneducated during archaic times. It provides knowledge to the
people. Now at this time, the popularity of books has been reduced by half, since the same
knowledge can be obtained in various forms and sources. As of now it is through technology,
people are able to access the sources. Though this accessibility is high on the chart the quality of
the stuff people gain through this is debatable. It is half cooked. Rumours and assumptions and
myths are mixed. Myth is there in history for a long period but it is beneficial for society and for
the people. But now, the rumours and stuff are happening for personal benefit. Hatred for a
particular group of people. The myth gets rooted stronger into people's mind as that is the real
thing happening with the fact and blindly follows it as it is the single source of truth. They rebel
for it as well. But the facts which they own are half cooked. The knowledge they possess now is
from the half cooked resource majorly passionate about their self purpose. Thus the knowledge
people own now is useless and still people need the essence of the book of genuity. The book
will survive.
