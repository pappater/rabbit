After a long
time I was into the photoshoot near my native. I was using Fujifilm monochrome. It was cloudy
already and the wind was just blowin all directions resembling an abyss. I rode on xl heavy duty
which went max 30 km which was the intention actually. It was a random route and I
photographed old men and temple figures. Met a couple of mens on the road and we were
introduced and blocked them from the work and had a photoshoot for less than 10 seconds. Just
a normal portrait. Old people are famous for their faces and it is fruit for street portrait
photographs. On shooting a couple of old folks, I just saw a fence less temple with the open
ground with the lord riding on a horse. It has an old classic vintage look. I spent some time
photographing them and I liked the eyes and the horse eyes.
The sky is getting dark and an old christian lady is just praying in front of the crowd. She just
blurted “JESUS, JESUS, JESUS ...” On realising it was an accident, I just enquired about the
place. It was a family who got injured. I don't know whether it is their less injury or the blessing
of Jesus on hearing the old lady's prayer. The family members were safe and they were taken to
the hospital. The old lady's lips widened after hearing this. She just thanked “JESUS” tilting her
head. Both were smiling.

I was reading some articles for the coming week Fakeleghorse weekly digest and I came across
http:www.baubauhaus.com/ and started to admire the site. It is simple and the content is of my
kind. I started seeing some Black and White illustrations and similar art forms. Thought of
doing an UX in Black and White but this time with purple instead of white. So I used the
Poikkal Kuthirai image and removed the background using removebg and started creating some
stuff at figma.com. If struck at some point, I scrolled baubauhaus and got some ideas from it. Just

drew some horizontal and vertical lines, formed a box, diagonal lines, increased the font size,
and played with words. Again I struck with the words to put in and I used today's date and day
and gave them some tinted cool overlay. Koi strikes again and I search for koi with the looks of
Japanese traditional art. Removed the background and again tinted a little bit and gave her a
border and placed her top right above the header. I liked this koi portion separately and
duplicated the current work area and replaced it with background removed koi fish and placed
the word "KOI" back and put some facts of her to the left.
I used a pencil tool to draw the face which I drew yesterday in my journal. Gave him a border
and painted him purple and placed him in the top centre.

Fakeleghorse,
a weekly digest, all about art, culture, books, music, movie and stuff non political mostly. I read
stuff on the internet and pick the right one worth reading for a week. I scan some art and
illustration in the same way. I did this manually without any involvement of bot or any similar
one. Everything is hand picked. The art and visual stuff are sent each week and put today in one
place, the Design Feed tab, which lets people see all those visual stuff that has been used in the
weekly digest. If you feel like sharing any visual or article stuff, just tag me @fakeleghorse.
