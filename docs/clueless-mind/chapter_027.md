# Chapter 27

Anything can
cross
our path, impact us, change the flow, result in good or bad, become wise or foolish and
everything solely depends on the stuff that is crossing. It can be people or emotion or laziness.
For me it is laziness that made me do a road trip for a week and here i’m sharing you the
experience about the trip.
The initial plan is to do cycling for a week but as I said in the intro, the laziness impacted me on
the plan and I changed to riding in a car for a longer distance. I planned not to go outside Tamil
Nadu and I thought to cover those districts which I have never been to before. Filled up the
tanks, the tyres are inflated normal and the snacks are stuffed, the hydrate bag is placed perfectly,
the shaders are doing their thing, the classic african pop is just invoking the vibe, I started the
road trip 6th early morning. I know, the starting few phases won’t excite me as I have already
been there in the path for millions of times. So just focusing on the classic african pop and
singing along with her. She is lovely and accompanied my whole solo trip. It was planned to do
80-100 kmh and I kept my word. The ECR is fun road for a ride. It is spacious enough to over
take and leaving space for two wheeler. It is also get us alert as the NH always make us sleepy. I
planned to ignore NH mostly in this trip.
Day 1
Pondicherry is a million times explored place for me and I didn't use google maps on her. I
simply went through some streets which I have never been on, as that is also a major intention
of the trip. Just to skip the bypass and explore the town more. Early days, a decade back, when
we took a government bus ride, it was mandatory to visit all the towns and there was no bypass
road concept. When the NH was good and fine and a bypass was introduced, most of the time
we preferred the bypass to ignore the town's beauty. It was Lunch time and I stopped at
Abhiram hotel, parked my car parallel to the parked vehicle, saluted the security, ordered a
special lunch meal, ate it full, paid, and returned to the car. A mechanic was trying to ask me for
any repair in the car and I gave him a tip and my car is fine. Further going, the roads are good
but stuffed heavily with vehicles. Since it is a weekday, I had less vehicles than usual, and I was
doing 80kmp with braking often and quarrelling with two wheeler. The plan was not to go by
destination so just went by the name board and saw Poompuhar. I know it is an old port area.
Managed to visit vaitheeswarar koil which is so empty and explored the entire temple in 5 mins.

Outside, the temple is filled with naadi josiyar shops and asking all the devotees to know nadi
yosiyam.
In Front of me, the name board says straight to mayavaram and so on. I know I just took a side
road from the NH that directs me to Poompuhar so instead of roaming I took the left small road
and I inquired whether this road connects NH and it was confirmed. This road is single lane
without any vehicle on the opposite side. On the NH I took the right and enquired again the
route of Poompuhar. I was told that a large arch will be there that indicates Poompuhar. After
riding for 10 mins, I saw the arch to my left and took that road. It is a branch road that leads
directly to the beach and it is lonely as hell. I was going at great speed and the landscape also
seemed to be greenish. One could easily identify we are reaching the beach by the change in
landscape and the white sand. I parked and went near the beach. It is old. Looked like it was not
rebuilt after the Tsunami. People installed fish food stalls and were demanding people to eat in
their stall. I ignored and moved to the big stones piled on the beach where people were sitting
and enjoying the beach. It is like half a km, the stones are poured into the edge of the beach.
Beyond them, there was an old lighthouse and it will make us doubt whether it is in use or not.
The walls are half decade old clearly showing that it was part of the tsunami attack and the
names writer on the walls is still visible now and it kind of looked like a mural art.
On the way back to the arch, on taking left will lead me to tharangambadi, an old danish town
still winding up the same vibe there. On entering the town, the streets of old danish
construction build and the entrance welcomes me and I was just exploring the street in my car
that I can do all day that I have never seen danish construction before. There was a three century
old church which had their church father's cemetery in the entrance. The word that is printed
on the stones is of old that gives the danish vibe again. I explored the text and learnt little stuff
on the style as well. It is also a beach but with a fort. The fort is not that much good from this
generation point of view but surely it did a lot three centuries back. I spent less time with the
beach and the fort and exploring the streets again as I liked the vibe it radiates. The day is
getting dark and I planned to halt the day at karaikkal. It belongs to pondicherry. I took the
coastal road which is quite similar to ECR. The town doesn't look like pondicherry. I explored
the town a bit by going random streets and searched for a good hotel to stay.
