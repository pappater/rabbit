# Chapter 51

It was said
that people live in the past in their mind mostly. Sometimes the present seems to be less
interesting than the past and it dominates the brain as it yields the enough pleasure and emotion
that is required for the brain which is not possible by the present moments, events and
emotions.
Also, this event and emotions are unique and private to the people it was connected to. Our
lives are like a single flow of timeline where people come in and go, creating events and
emotions. None of the events and emotions are labelled like “Sharable” or “Not Sharable”, but it
was decided upon in conversing with the people (in converse), that some of the other people's
events or emotions are shared. It is a matter of how well the people in converse are connected
and take you to reveal the events and emotions from the past.
Even each and every person will have some events and emotions which are secret to themselves
that they might have not shared to their close people like their partners or close friends. It is not
intentionally hiding, but even the conscious mind ignores it, that it ain’t suitable for sharing.
Why is it that we are pressured to share everything from the past to our life partner ? How does
it show them the character you have ? Even the character is so inconsistent that for each and
every person we come across, we show different us and different characters.
