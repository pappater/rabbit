And the day
was so suspenseful and it didn’t hold any of the data of what was going to happen; yet when
things happened, it got its numerous judgement, label, events and emotions. And among this,
the suspense would be the common which hold an emotion which is strange one, and it gets
instated resulted in any of the consequence it lead, it may of positive or negative and it also
creates a series of question, that gets asked, but not spending much time in seeking the answer
to but to enjoy the beauty of how well the question is put forward, and it tells on how intellect
oneself was, admired; wondered; regretted as it moves further in digging deep about the
question, lost its freshness, withdrawn and got over with it. And it is also should be noted that
once the suspense is crossed either in positive or negative way, the event skips the suspense stuff
and cling to the freshly triggered event and it most of the time is not that intense when it
initially was intended.
