It is a
known fact by all highway riders that wherever the rows of trucks halted at night for the dinner,
the chances of getting tasty food is high. The hotel lights are painted green indicating that it is a
hotel which has certain quality and quantity that satisfy the truck drivers. It used to be the older
tradition to follow this kind of thing down south. Still in some places, this tradition is followed.
I came to see this green lighted hotel which was already packed with the rows of trucks in the
front.
I parked and went inside to have dinner. The taste is good. It was only me who was an outsider.
Rest of the people are truck drivers. It is like they are regular customers to this hotel. All tables
are filled with random drivers who share the journey and those of newbies getting suggestions
and advice from the experienced driver.
The status of truck drivers in India reports that overall, 53% of respondents are dissatisfied with
their profession. Over 9 out of 10 respondents (93%) confirmed that other than salary/wages,
they do not get any social security benefits (such as provident fund, pension, health insurance,
life insurance, gratuity, etc.) At present, Rs. 47,852.28 crore (approx. 6.7 billion USD) per year is
the estimated bribe amount in the trucking operations. This is higher than the reported figure
of Rs. 22,048.20 crore in 2006-07. On an average, respondents drive for nearly 12 hours in a day
and cover a distance of 417 km daily. Almost 50% of the respondents said they drive vehicles
even if they are feeling fatigued or sleepy. More than 1 in 5 (22%) respondents said they take
some kind of drugs during trips.
One of the newbie drivers who looks like just turned 18 is operating a heavy vehicle with loaded
machinery which is not tied up properly. When he was in his 60s, the vehicle was not stable
which may have caused the accident. He was checking for any thread availability inorder to tie
up the machinery. The host who loaded the machinery must have to verify this kind of thing
beforehand in order to solve this kind of issue in the middle of the night where almost 90
percent of shops will get closed where the driver risks their life to continue their night journey.
