# Chapter 56

Blues is
everywhere.
It is a music genre which can be played for years by knowing a single blues scale. He used to play
D or G or C depending on the mood. His room is either filled with blues music from the radio
or him playing blue on keys or harmonica. He lives in a dark room where a dim yellow light
pushes hard to give some light. The walls are stuffed with frames and masks and stuff.
Sometimes, the fish tank bubbles accompany his blues stuff.
It is all set and prepared for the weekend jamming session. It was his first at a tiny restaurant at
the street corner. He is doing it for free as this kind of stuff is new to people. He jams at the
subways, street, restaurant, market but no one gives a damn about it. So mostly he does it for
free. It was his friend's brother's restaurant where the session was going to happen.
He was so excited about tomorrow's session thing. He was picturing himself playing harmonica
and keys and planning how things should be done and all. And after some time he realised
nothing was going to happen yet he kind of like this picturing stuff. It was scheduled for 7 in the
evening. He got up, wrapped his things for the session and headed over to a nearby coffee shop.
The morning vendor installing their stalls, the street is getting its life and the crowd is slowly
spreading like a cancer on the street.
He ordered coffee and decided to watch people. There was cat on the street, little boy chasing
the balloon, a guy over a phone, a lady with her plants, old people watching the ground and
going somewhere to get fresh air, the sky is blue, the shredded wall post flying along with the
dust and stuff, and an old man with his cat sat opposite to him.
The old man took out his morning newspaper and skimmed over it. The cat is just watching
humans and stuff. He tried to poke the cat but she didn’t give a damn and he ain’t got nothing to
do so he was thinking of roam the street for a while. Maybe the old man skimmed the
newspaper scene might have seeded slightly into his head, he got a sudden urge to read
something. He roamed and found a book stall and got a 90 page book. He is always scared to
read bigger books. He hesitated for a while but he got some courage there to get the 90 page
book. He returned back to the same restaurant, sat opposite to the cat and started to read some
pages.

He completed the book within half an hour. Something is revealed to him when he finishes
reading the book. He liked to reread it again. He does that. And again he got something from the
book. He started to enjoy reading those lines. He again headed over to the same book stall and
got another book of bigger size and he started reading at the same spot. It was literary stuff. It
gave him clarity about a lot of things he was aware but not exactly aware of. It confirms the
things that are in doubt in his mind. He got addicted to words, sentences, passages, paragraphs,
chapters and volumes. Some words just rolled in his head for a while. The book seeded
something different in his mind. He felt fresh and started off to the restaurant where the blues
session was going to happen.
