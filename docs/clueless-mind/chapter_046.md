# Chapter 46

It was
unexpected
weather that turned dark before dusk, and the strong wind dominated initially, but later was
dominated by thunder and lightning. He was doing the routine work of journalizing and reading
novels. The oil lamp struggled a bit then died as it is hard to maintain as all the electricity had
gone out. The muffled sound hits hard and joins with the thunder, signalling people to witness
its marvellous play. The lightning revealed an extraordinary landscape for a second that no one
had ever seen before, and it made admiration and disgust at the same time as its power plucked
the pupil for a bit. The earthly odour starts to evolve and fill the air among the people's bodies,
which makes it a refreshing feeling to enjoy this ongoing parade. As all the sensory organs were
in full swing, so did the hearing that captured each and every bit of this drizzling. Like a drum
roll increasing eventually, the drizzling gets its tempo and hits the max, pouring like hell until it
becomes a noisy voice from all the mixture of sounds. But among these sounds, one was unique,
and it hit him differently. It is coming from the window side, and it is the wailing of a puppy
that was born a couple of days back. Its den was fit to keep predators out but not strong enough
for the sudden change in the climate.
The puppies' chorus did something to him. He felt sorry for the dog and puppies. At that time,
he felt a different emotion which was not of sympathy but a different one for him to
understand. The puppies' sufferings were hitting him so hard that he was trying to get the
puppies' sufferings and was willing to put on his and suffer for them. It gave him a feeling of
pleasure, satisfaction, purpose, and much more, much more like first love would appear to a
person. So strong and new and indescribable. As the wailing continues, he is just willing to get
all those puppies suffering. And it lasted so long that it made him pleased as the wailing kept on
increasing. He got to know that as the pleasure increases, he is indirectly getting all the puppies'
suffering. At one point, when it was at its maximum, all this feeling suddenly stops as the
wailing and the sudden rain stop. Everything became normal, and he lit a candle and returned to
journaling what he felt.
The morning was ruined. It was a nice sunny day, but something strange still hung within him.
He tries to recreate the emotion that he felt last night but couldn’t. This made him sad. There
was chaos in front of the office building. People gathered, and all their eyes looked at the
opposite apartment, a third-floor veranda, where a similar wailing sound echoed. It was from a
lady about 30 years old. She beats her husband and curses. The man getting hit didn’t show any

violence or anger, instead he accepted it as if he deserved to get hit. The lady didn't care about
the others but was wailing in a ruined tone that none was able to get what the issue was. The
crowd just passed various rumours, and it doesn't make sense for such a violent event. Both the
man and the woman were suffering. out of the blues. It was said that the man had an affair, so
the violence. He was trying to get the couple suffering to feel like what he felt when the puppies
were wailing from yesterday's rain. But he couldn’t. He was trying hard to grasp their suffering,
but no, it was not happening this time.

Friday.
Created an account in chat gpt, a popular AI chat based bot where I google how to write non
fiction books and stuff. The topic that was in my mind was how to be a poor man. Currently, I
was reading Rich dad and poor dad, and from there I got the inspiration to do some analysis on
writing some stuff on this. But it wasn’t easy. Nothing comes to my mind. As I was scrolling
through the web, I came across Sylvia Plath, the author and now it is urging me to read the bell
jar novel. The one hundred years of solitude was more confusing than expected. With the stuff
piling up on my writing table, the artist's mind was firing inside some stuff. But there is a lot of
stuff on the plate to eat.
Two movies are done. The salesman and The man without the past. I liked the second one. It
was subtle and delivered it nicely. How beautiful if stuff were simple.
