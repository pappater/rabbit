# Chapter 60

102
The blue dizzy
sky is slowly disappearing to a golden wheat. I was on the way from trivandrum to somewhere.
The draft was to go along the sea at the right side till it reached somewhere. The fuel tank was
dumped full and the journey has started. Since it was at the time the road work was going on, I
was diverted to some rural routes where the route is actually on the seashore. One can see the
waves crashing over the rocks and it fragments over the face. This rural route took me to a
church backyard where it was a home for 100 plus graveyards. Our childhoods are mostly filled
with the haunting stories about graveyards and stuff but the truth is it has its beauty. At the huge
church in the background with hundreds of cross signs piled on the foreground, it was a perfect
delight for photographers and I used the opportunity. It was a squared room hotel, where its
mouth opened towards the road. I parked my wheeler and entered to have my breakfast. The
so-called hotel was unloaded with two tables for eating on the right, one on the left for the
owner and to the left corner for the chef. I shoved some food. Since it was school hours, it was
proposed by some school fellas to drop them at school. The way they hitchhiked showed they
have more heed towards bikes than schooling. The street was seized by a vertical tower painter
red and white horizontal. The beacon was beaming from its head. Nearby the lighthouse, a fleet
of boats floating on the estuary. Past some miles where the bay of bengal starts and india ocean
ends, one could catch the glimpse of windmills that are planted on earth. It whirl as the tempo
varied randomly. It was 11 past quarter, lone lane, wind farm to the left and a couple of mounds
to the right.
The reddish sand slowly emerges from its ground as the miles keep on its track. In front of me, I
saw a cross sign floating above the road. Is it a miracle of Jesus christ. Or it was a trick of mirage.
It was nature. An old village church once built on the floor is almost covered with red sand.
One can fancy it like an old church found on the slopes of a desert mound in thar. For some
moment, I was uncertain about the location I was currently in. Now I was hit by fragmented red
sand. Two past half, I was travelling again on a lone track where everywhere I saw mirages. One
has to tilt the head full backward to meet the vertical sun. I crossed three dry spelled river paths.
I stopped at a scene where it happened on the dry spelled river path. A woman sucks water from
a well and returns back home via the cracks of the river path. Some people have a trolley of
buckets to draw water from well. Herds of sheep grazing on the black soil everywhere. No
farming, no water, no agriculture, but still people surviving with the stuff provided by nature. I
was welcomed by a board saying Ervadi Dargah. On entering, I was greeted by a wail of old men
making chaos and hastern here and there. One more lady was tied up by her hand on the tree
that stood amid the dargah. Everywhere wail echoed. It was a place for treating mentally ill
people.
The black soil transforms white gradually. The sun was at a perfect angle, where its ray strikes
on the salt flats and reflects back to the pupil. The road smells salty and fresh. The mirage is

filled with salt moisture. Miles and miles of white salt flats with a thatched hut at the centre. It
looked like the hut was the entrance to heaven. The golden wheat is back again to the sky as it
was in the background to my view where a silhouthe train is passing parallelly as a foreground.
The dusk forms a filter that coloured the soil light yellow. The filter added more flavor to the
brig and boat and train that passing pamban bridge. I was one among the crowd to witness the
moving chariot.
Commenced the next day with the same blue dizzy sky. Now with the bay of bengal on both
sides of the road. An old carrack hit the shore. Group of men stand in a straight line holding a
thread and doing some stuff. Women and men on the streets opened their shops and began their
routines. Horizon is filled with boats and fishermens. I was wheeling in a speed, a walking lady
of the 90s can take me over. I wheeled 10 miles till the blue faded to golden. The morning wind
with salty moisture refreshes. The smell of fish everywhere. Half past the distance, an Old
abandoned church at my right. Further continuing, an old abandoned railway station at left. I
was enlightened by an old preacher who lived at the time where the station was alive, that the
train from chennai to ceylon stops there and picks people by boat to drop them at the tip of
north sri lanka and continues further by train again. It was during this process a cyclone hit this
place and spoiled it entirely. One could walk to Sri lanka if the sea level is low. I was ruminating
at the edge of dhanushkodi and reckoning for a walk over. The fishermen moved from bank to
bank. I was collecting bivalvia, sea shells, hard clams, cockles, limpets and other stuff like three
kg in weight. The dizzy blue fades and golden emerges at the background and the boat moves
horizontally as foreground. I belong there. The sound of flat waves, the smells of the shore, the
blue sea, the golden dawn, the fishermen, the boat, the brig, the limpets, the sea shells. I belong
there. Wish i was a fisherman.
