It is of
all of sudden, the place that was expected not be seen, was seen, and upon continuing, without
the white guiding line, it looked like it was an abyss, without an end, and some patch on the side
revealed, it got end and the mist was spread all over the places, making dull everywhere and the
peacock chocking and cock cooing and dogs barking and the corner tea shop start making
coffees and the sunday morning was slowing starting off with the expectation of crowd that to
gather and the gang waiting to get paid with the information and the contact they hold within
the authority was succeeded at the end by providing the information as well the implementation
of stuff and it was some beggers on the street, so called saint, was also in contact with them and
they too got paid with the stuff saying it was not supposed to take outside and everything has to
be within the premises and it was done as said and at out, there was a discussion of elite group,
asking question and stuff to the quality of information the gang had, and with half hesitation,
they moved to follow those again till the saint got his stuff.

climbed on top of the roof, safe and secure and staring at the dog's inability and vibing with it. It
was the pond nearby, that reflecting this scene in blurred and the highway hold the parked car
on both side, caused traffic jam, raised conflict and chaos, ignored and scene was into the garden
of plants and stuff where the fella holding his tobacco, stuffing in his mouth and starting
ploughing the fella and making comments to the women that were entering the place for their
daily work.
