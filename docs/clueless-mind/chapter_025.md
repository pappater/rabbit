I was doing
some UX work in figma. I usually visit webpages for their typography, graphic design, scrolling
effect, animations and stuff. I was recently checking the UX community in reddit. People were
just looking for user experience in such a vector graphical site. This vector graphical site is
mainly designed for its look and feel in the first place as the user intervention is ignored in most
of the places. But still people were just putting the standard landing page template to these
vector graphical sites which is not fair in my point of view. Nowadays people expect the non
serviceable websites to be a showcase material. They like to stare and scroll. Let's give them
some peace via doing such a website.
