As mentioned
in
the earlier post, figma is a pretty good online tool where we can replace XD totally. I saw today
on Reddit about a prototype that is well framed and animated.

This proved that the figma can be used for high complex UX as well. In search of finding its
treasure, I was exploring the options and I was struck on how to make all the frames scroll
vertically in presentation mode. I searched google for the work but my search keyword was the
worst because it always gets me the result of making a carousel on figma. I finally figured out
how to place the frame, the order and all and I got the result of vertically scrolling.
The left panel has the frames and elements that we have used in prototyping. The base of those
elements to be placed is a frame. Create a new frame. This is the initial base frame from where
we will be placing the other frames below to view it in a vertically scroll.
