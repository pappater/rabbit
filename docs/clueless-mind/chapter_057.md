# Chapter 57

98
The very
beginning
of the day before like three hours back on the highway 45 that one couldn’t see clearly what is in
front that you feel like you lost in a abyss along with the motor car sound accompanying you
that leads to a sudden crash on a big stone like object later seems to a repaired lorry on the same
highway. The same happened to the following cars and two were lying on the side of the road
like a dead dog or a cow. But did actually escape from the crash and lying there to realize what
was happening and he could see one of the other drivers is dead and the lorry driver returning
with the shout by seeing the accident.
