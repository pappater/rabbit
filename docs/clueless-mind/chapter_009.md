No man will
like to stay low. If at all he thinks/decides to stay low. If an external thing acts upon him to stay
low or a slave kind of stuff, he won’t accept that fact. A man feels inferiority complex when he
lacks skill or power or anything that he can’t possess or he owes something. When he is a
learner, he respects his teacher as he accepts this as a natural blueprint since the knowledge that
the teacher possesses is more than his. This is applicable to some other factor like power, wealth
etc., this kind of low doesn’t affect him. And in some scenarios, he himself keeps low or some
factor similar to inferiority complex where the opposite party doesn’t cause any impact on him
but he stays low. That is some theory regarding how the brain works in this situation. When he
works under a landlord, he stays low since he owes something in return for the salary he gets.
The above mentioned factors are ignored since it happens within him based on some factors
and no external factors. But...
But here is a situation where a man rages spontaneously not thinking a bit about his
consciousness. It is when he is treated low when he owes nothing. It is some kind of invisible
force that acts upon him which creates this rage. It is also expressed externally which may lead
to violence and stuff. It can lead to mental and physical disturbance. He can hurt those who cast
the invisible force. This rage happens because the opposite party stays top when a man owes
nothing. The opponent party rages again for the same reason that he too won’t stay low if he
demands. So this stack overflows on and on and it leads to violence/some unknown chaos on
both the parties. Which in turn creates a situation that even leads to death.
If any one party's conscience decides how to handle this rage, then none would have happened.
Say if his conscience told him to treat equal when the opposite party is even lower than him,
then the rage would have been destroyed at that instance. Even the opposite party can’t continue
the stack since he can’t rage solo.
If a man can accept his inferiority complex, then he can also accept this equity. Allow his
consciousness some time to decide. It Will take care of it. Just allow.
