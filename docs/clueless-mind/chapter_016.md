# Chapter 16

It just
happened
a week back. I parked at the curb and thought of getting some stuff from the subway restaurant.
I was the second one to order and it's been a couple of years since I ordered there. The guy who
ordered first, was a pro subway customer. He orders like he used to eat here every morning and
afternoon and evening and night. He orders what he knows. He has company with him. His
girlfriend. He is impressing her. And he is on his way to success. When his order got over, he
asked his girlfriend to customize her food. She got struck and didn't know what the hell to do
next. Her boyfriend took charge of her and they went out.
It is my turn, the guy taking orders is native. I'm damn sure about it. For him, the speed of
speaking English is more important than blurting them out clearly. If he says something in slow
English, he is judged and embarrassed for not knowing fast english. And this time, i didn't get
anything from him, because he is embarrassed to talk about it slowly. I was asking him twice to
get what he was saying and started my customization. I moved to the next part where I was
asked to choose bread. I didn't know what type of bread they had. I know somewhere they put it
for the customer to order. But it was not catchy and I was searching and finally found and
ordered my bread. The next step to get a meal is to select the veggie. I chose the stuff I know,
and there was no label on the olive, pickle and stuff(would be hard for a layman for the first time
to figure it out ). Then the next procedure is to pick the sauce. It was horrible. I got my stuff to
eat.
I feel embarrassed to order simple food to eat because I don't know what they put in them, or
the bread or the sauce or and so on. Why do they in the first step speak in English rather than
the native. The fella took the order, knew I was native guy and I knew the native language. But
why is there a lack of communication ?
If the procedure were of native form, I would have customized a damn good food to eat but it
ended up with a disaster as they lack a lot of communication. This raised a lot of questions.
People nowadays learn stuff mainly to make other people embarrassed. I'm not telling everyone,
but some people with vanity choose to be like this. I’ve faced many scenarios like this after this
realisation. If a fella unlearns something which is in trend there he was made to be embarrassed
by the learned person. It is just a tiny line that divides this vanity and sharing. If he really wants

to share his learning, he should make others understand what and how to proceed rather than
make it embarrassing.
Internally he is forced to conceal this embarrassment by following some shitty trend. This trend
is actually someone’s originality. What is the use of copying someone’s originality by being
yourself embarrassed. Lot of stuff is happening inside which is not known to the individual but
all they do is to conceal the embarrassment.
And I won't blame only people. It is natural for human beings to react to certain emotions and it
is good to go but who is creating this embarrassment ? This embarrassment is caused mainly
due to lack of knowledge and if the subway provided that knowledge by labeling the veggie, I
would have been killed at its birth. But the company's selling point is creating those kinds of
embarrassing situations in which people will make the embarrassment stuff to their friend and
family and they to their friend and the chain keeps on looping. Or just put the stuff in layman
point of view which is clearly understandable by all the other geniuses out there.
And one more thing I found is why we are so much embarrassed of being native. All we get
embarrassed about is from the western or some other template which they put in ours. He is so
good at his native stuff. He can speak clearly in his native language, he can dress well and feel
comfortable with his native dress, he can order his native food so well, he can cook his native
food well, but some minority of people think, other cultures' templates are so cool and trying to
fix that with native is a foolishness. It is different when you are curious and mean to know their
culture. But when you feel embarrassed about native stuff and follow other templates to pride
yourself, and create vanity is purely foolishness. The nation's emotion is killed at this point. And
the non native template is of no use here to build a strong nation.
