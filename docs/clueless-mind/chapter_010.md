# Chapter 10

An old
abandoned
tea factory. It is a lifeless village. Yet people live there. For there is no more tea plantation. Old
tea shop gets village necessities from down the foothill. No faith in their future but praying all
day at church. One time public transport available that too depends on the number of
passengers.
Group of people circled near a pit where a scream echoed from it. It was a non-human echo. A
deer fawn leaps hard to get out of it. Its muzzle is already painted red yet bids for his survival.
Yesternight rain made the worst of the landslide on the other side of the village. People fix it
with the stone and stuff from nearby. It is hard to see one’s whole face clearly in the village. It is
always coated by a figment cloud emerging when smutter the rock or
Obstructed by the mist.
No young face. All their childrens were settled in the town as surviving in such a kind of village
is absurd. If you ask them to leave the village, they hesitate to do so as they don’t know anything
other than living in the wild.
They rescued the fawn. But none to rescue them.
Recommencing further from the village is a British bungalow. It is haunted, says the villagers. It
is constructed in such a way that the officer is in a position to see the tea plantation landscape on
the right and a reservoir on the left.
If at all newcomers to the village don’t have access to stay, they can in any of the houses by
noticing them prior. That is the rules they follow. That is how we followed long back but not
now. The road to the foothill from the village is blocked by the roots of large trees that were
rolled recently due to the storm. One can see the impressive pattern plumage of peacock on the
edge of the plucked root that is one storey.
The engine is killed. The zig zag road trip smoothened silently by just rolling the wheel on the
slopes. It was an hour-long buoyant roll along the storm destruction path. It is not a destruction
if it is done by nature where it has its own beauty. Have you seen the root of a tree the size of
one storey building ?
