I recently
came
across a tool for creating UX design. Usually people use Adobe XD for doing such creative stuff.
It required some decent computers, knowledge of the tool and required some cash in doing
some creative stuff. It is a hectic one and I personally hate XD for so many other reasons which
are off topic as of now.Figma https:www.figma.com/. The good thing about figma is it is a web
application and we can design a UX via any web browser. It is free, it is so simple and
straightforward. In UX design, learning the tool is just 10% of stuff required and the rest is
creative. I just created a simple page using figma and it is so easy and simple to use. Initially I
was blank and was thinking of creating something mind blowing. But doing stuff simple always
makes the job easier and I just started off the design with the header. Thought of making the
usual horizontal header to be vertical with a pair. I kind of liked it. Filled the background with
red and changed the alignment a bit. Using a pen tool, I scribbled something on the right with a
little dark red. Removed Fyodor Dostoevsky background using https:www.remove.bg/. Added
his name and birth year. Found some quotes of his from The Brother Karamazov and just added
like a line and it was the intention to do it in such a way. Finally filled some space with an arrow.
Below is the output of it.If you are really good with creative skill, just dig this web app to
become a designer. It doesn't take much time and it doesn't need to be cased. Just for some
creative pleasure doing this kind of stuff gives you peace sometimes. If not, just ignore my
statement.
