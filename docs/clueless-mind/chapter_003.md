# Chapter 3

9
It’s the stage
of your mind where you feel like a preacher to volunteer yourself to let people know what’s
going on in your head. People might take it or leave it but you are just willing to let them know
the new invention happened within yourself. You just walk on the street alone without
knowing your legs fainted yet you get satisfied with the knowledge you gained. At times you feel
like you have experienced all the emotions and stuff a wise man gets to attain his nirvana.
Thinking of philosophical stuff makes you feel like you attained nirvana. You thought you had
faced all the troubles that people were scared to face. You thought there were no other problems
a man can face in his life and yet you have faced and experienced it. You feel like you can write a
novel about the philosophical stuff that you have
gained. But did you know what will happen after that ?
Have you thought that you might get a chance to
experience the whole thing again and again ? Have you
really attained nirvana ? Did you really think that ? By
the time you were in the stage of thinking about this,
life was already rooted to show you how life actually
will be. You have not even done half way to attain
nirvana. You were in the process. You still have a lot of
things to face and experience. Don’t conclude this is the
end of the world. You're gonna be disappointed. You
will again fail, again a heart break, again a heartache,
again a first love, again a feel of lust, again a preacher's
thought, again a lonely life. And this keeps on going.
You just can’t control this stuff. You are still in the
process of attaining nirvana. Just go in a flow.
