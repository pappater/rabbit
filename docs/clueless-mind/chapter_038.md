Local train announcement, was blurting out at the Mambalam railway station. There was a
constant sound of people, train announcements, advertisements from the shops and everything
clubbed together to form a huge sound of Ranganathan Street. The street is as usual crowded
and noisy and at the corner there was an Anbalagan fruit stall which is an older one and on
entering the basement, it was so hot as there was no ventilator, the AC was turned off. Since
there is no customer it was in such a state and it was asked and requested to turn on so that the
ventilators were proper and stuff. Still people were crossing the road in front of a Saravana
Selvaratnam shop for more than 10 years I guess and earlier where Saravana Bhavan Hotel was
supposed to be was now replaced with Murugan Idli shop now the same Saravana Bhavan is on
the backside which can be navigated upon taking the next left Street and on the initial view, the
hotel seems to be a less quality compare to the earlier one and the serving is so dull, the dining is
happening outdoor and overall it’s not as before classic one. Play the film while charging
hundred rupees for the parking around the Panagal Park and it is the only parking space
available within Ranganathan Street. Hotel Aishwarya Bhavan was closed as it was the only
hotel which is situated near to the Mambalam railway station to the left of this hotel bar a
universal mobile shop which was now replaced with some textile shop.
