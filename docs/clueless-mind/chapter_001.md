It was
unconscious
and infinite numbers of time, the tea master had twizzled and poured the tea to the glass, that
arranged symmetrically, picked one at the time, dropped abruptly at the table, signalling its
completeness; that was picked by a dark hand, rolled rudrakshai at the wrist and pans carefully
to his mouth, sipping, and in ecstasy and blissfulness, shifted his head slightly to left and right,
wears a white dash of vibhuti, centred with small red kungumam dot, and back to reality, when
the television was loud enough to blurt out the crime scene from some local village. He then
back to his previous thoughts of doubtfulness; where it showcased and raised a question
whether his front gate of his farm at the hill side that was surrounded by tiny rocks of different
form, remote it was that only the goat and local dogs roam hither and thither; filled with excess
of water from december rain; and none of the human soul would know such a farm exists that
the gate, that was painted blue and bordered red; was in closed condition or not. It was this
thought that triggered when he reached the destination of the tea shop; and was in a condition
that it was not possible to travel back thither, the farm with the front gate painted blue and
bordered red; and hence isolated with his thought of doubtness alone, regretting the thoughts,
and also for its occurrence that distract the blissfulness caused by the tea that was dropped
abruptly by the tea master on the table. And with the political rumours being telecasted on the
television, he was back to the present, and intermittently was worried with the doubtfulness,
like the stone that caught inside his shoe.
And next to him was another man, who wear a sadness and unshaven beard of white and grey,
aged 60, was staring down at the bottom left leg of the table down, making false conversation
within himself, regarding some past unpleasant event that was bugged him for long, about his
village at the sea shore, a tiny one, that run parallel to the canal, that the cows grazing beyond
that, and the tar roads were filled with dunkards and dust and stuff, was all of sudden
embarrassed and awkward by the witness; the event of ladies; using the public open space as
toilet and to conceal this event of embarrasement, he turned abruptly, acting not noticed, with
blank thought, not known how to get distract, was in conversation on his mind, in seek of
justice, with the government and law and stuff; intensed; flowed with the series of question and
stuff; with the improvisation in the thought; pleasured; was all of sudden interrupted; by the
bang on the table, by the tea master who dropped the freshly poured tea glass, on table, where he
moved his stare from the lower left leg to the table slab, picked, paned, sipped, and settled to

present for some time, ecstasy, blissed, realised, dried, tilted, witnessed, heard, some random
news from the television, that was blurting about some suicide case.
And at the back, there was a laugh, a pale man, aged 40, hair dyed, showcased two rows of
frontal teeth, bright, laughed heavy, by the excitement of the event which involved in hatching
of 35 crocodile eggs, that was tracked and protected for 90 days at the conservation and the
thought of first time witnessing the crackage of the egg, where it emits the peak that consists of
nostrils and gradually it reveals the eye and the whole head comes out of the white shell, then
the front right and left leg; and the rear left and right one, to the mud now and was watching
him, his dyed hair, from those little dark and yellowish eye, rotating, dwarf one and he, was in
connection with them, the thirty plus dwarf crocodiles. With this excitement, it was interrupted
by the cunningness that involved deception where for the three glass of tea, he paid two, and
caught; embarrassed; not had clue what has happened; was in process to settle things right; paid
the third tea amount; worried, internally justified and realised the cause of deception which was
unintentional, and wondered it cause of occurrence, of its cunning nature, was half convinced
that it is not of his plan to cheat; with the double mindedness to not to settle with two side,
depressed, and moved, sat near the old man with the white and grey beard who was talking to
himself with false conversation, for the justice, to build the public toilet; was ignored and tilted
to the direction of television that was blurting about the forest fire that killed 90% of animals
and other living being thither.

“
I used to analyze myself down to the last thread, used to compare myself with others, recalled all
the smallest glances, smiles and words of those to whom I’d tried to be frank, interpreted
everything in a bad light, laughed viciously at my attempts ‘to be like the rest’ –and suddenly, in
the midst of my laughing, I’d give way to sadness, fall into ludicrous despondency and once
again start the whole process all over again – in short, I went round and round like a squirrel on
a wheel.”
― Fyodor Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment
