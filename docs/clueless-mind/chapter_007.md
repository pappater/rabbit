# Chapter 7

Call me
Ishmael.
All it started from there and it just made me fall into the vortex for a month and half of reading
the Biblical referenced content of Moby Dick. Before reading this book my version of the whale
is of shark countenance but the book reveals the zoological portion of a great whale that is
sprouting mist aloft the deep
blue archipelago sea to
enlighten me it is not so.
The interior and exterior
portions, the skeleton, flukes,
eyes, jaws, brain, sperm, and
almost everything is explored
in this epic. Their by-product,
their power, the treacherous
things we did to whales during
the uncivilised/civilised period
and so on. All those pictures of
Monstrous watery leviathan
are actually wrongly portraits
of the Great Whale.
Whaling is not like fishing but an art. That is what this book tells us. I appreciate the author for
this in depth effort in doing research on whales and tangling this adventurous fictional epic
which led the reader at least to start fishing.
