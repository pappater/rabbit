The father,
the son upon long walk on the pedestrian heading towards the sun that was about to set which
results in dimming the natural light of it and alerting the street vendors to light up the man
made one to guide the path that led the duo to a small street food corner which displayed the
tempting dish menu to order some motton, chicken and a good meal for the night is done
pleasantly. Upon finishing it off, they smoked and joined with another fella who accompanied
them on smoke and happened to know that he was the bus driver who was going to take them
to the duo's village right on the east coastal seashore that faced toward Bay of Bengal.
It was the death of the grandmother of the son. Nothing was shown to the duo that such a thing
happened. They started the morning with their regular routine and walked to the father's
childhood house. It was all of a sudden that some emotional river flowed through both that the
father wailed from the bottom of his stomach that made the tiny dust on the floor to migrate
and settle somewhere till the wailing things got settled down. The father's mind slowly realized
the reduction in the intensity of the wailing, and he stopped and returned to the crowd that
gathered and watched the duo as the whole ceremony was on hold for days for their visit and to
perform the last rituals. The son too backed after a while, indicating that the relationship
between grandmother and grandson is more emotional than mother and son.
The cried up faces freshened up after the cremation and the gathered crowd joined again for a
nicely arranged dinner which made people look like such a past death event ever happened
there. All done and energized and formed a circle for discussing the main event of the ceremony
which is not the death but the asset's split. It was planned by the children of the dead mother to
melt all the Jewel that remains and make the split even to not cause any issues among them and
at the same time nothing more has to be given to any of the others.
But the oneness did not help the siblings as each had their favorite spot of the house which
happens to be the Pooja room and main hall to keep hold on the luck and superstitious only to
themselves that made them stubborn to not to agree to hand over to anyone but willing to let it
get ruined. And the siblings of the matured class assumed that the stubbornness would
eventually be gone, and they would agree upon splitting the house based on the order of the
siblings born. But it was not the case as the time and days were going on, the siblings slowly
moved back to their own places, making hold of the current affair to be taken care of later. As
the day, month, year and decade passed, none came forward or willing to sacrifice on letting
someone take control of the house to make it survive. But the stubborn jealousy makes them
think that it has to be for them or for none.
The soulless house suffered a lot, and slowly it melted due to the extreme weather where
eventually its roof, paint, floor melted and stood there like a shapeless form which changed

accordingly to provide shelter for weeds and small animals. Yet the people's stubbornness never
changed.
