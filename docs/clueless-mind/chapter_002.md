People, why
are
people troubling people ? It ain’t like they are troubling intentionally by doing stuff but if people
entered into your life, then reserve a moment of experience to your life list. Whether you love
or hate folks, one or the other way they're gonna create trouble for you. That is how it was
designed. Can you escape from this sinkhole ? Can people help you to come out of it? No. Even
if you plan perfectly by knowing all the consequences that are gonna cause if people enter your
life, it's gonna suck anyway. The plan won’t work even though you planned perfectly. Then
what will be the solution to this heck ? Is it death ? Have people found and preached to people ?
Maybe it might have happened. It is kind of death but your soul still lives on the earth. Death is
like when you are empty without a soul. Empty without soul by body. What if it is empty with
soul ? Have you ever been on a lone walk on the street under the flickering light and jamming
random riffs on harmonica ? That would be empty with soul. You are alone, no one is there for
you. You are an independent soul. You are empty. Your mind is emptied with the random riffs
coming somewhere from your head and you still got your soul and you are not dead. People
trouble people. Get rid of them. People are the cause and effect. It is better to get rid of the cause
so the effect won’t impact you. Is it really possible for a man to be living alone his whole life ?
Can anyone be like that ? History has known and unknown people who lived alone their whole
life. It can be seen that it is against the law to live like that but there are some people who live
alone and it is the law for them to be alone. If they live with people, it is against the law for
them. So living alone is possible. You have no trouble since no people can be involved in your
life, no idiot can ruin your life, no one can make you angry and it goes on. You really don’t have
trouble ? Have you ever been alone for a long time ? If you are curious to be alone, just try it for
once. Still you will have trouble. But this time it's not by the people but by yourself. Yes this time
it is you that is causing trouble for yourself. When you are alone, you will feel the inner peace
within you, you will think a lot like a preacher and preach to people as well. You really know
yourself better than earlier. You feel the newer version of yourself. But it won’t last long as it is
how it all meant for folks. It won’t last long. You have to suffer. Either by you or by people. That
is the design. That is what folks do. It ain’t sin. This time the suffering is by you. You are
jamming from your soul and you got a riff that makes you wonder that you have beaten
Beethoven In composition. And you just thought of sharing the very moment to someone else
in the world. And the very happiest moment is partially satisfying because happiness is real
when it is shared. There comes the trouble oh man. There comes the real trouble. Now the lone
man needs someone to share his happiness. Yes, he needs people. He knows, if people are there,

troubles will be marching towards him. Even though he won’t care about that. Trouble ain’t
bothering him at that very moment. He wants someone to share his feelings. And if he follows
that emotion it is like the cat catching her tail. Again people trouble people. Becoming an aloof
man. Tempting again to people. What if he cares about none. What if he ain’t giving a damn
thing about anything or anybody ? Since he cares about the very moment, it leads to sharing
with someone to satisfy his happiness. What if he didn't care about that stuff and just moved to
the next riff that was even better than the previous one ? The cause and effect caused by the
effect of care is more dangerous than anything else. Just imagine if you care none will it gonna
affect you in any other way ? No, right ? But is it a proper way to behave ? You really don’t care
when you are willing to don’t give a care. But you can’t force yourself to behave like you are not
caring about anything. You can do that temporarily but it won’t last long. You can train your
brain to be like not caring about telling them scary stuff but even it won’t last long. You do care
man. Yes you do care. People care about people. That's how it was designed. People need People.
Then why is there chaos among the life of a man ? Is it really because of people ? Is he really
causing all sorts of trouble ? yes it is caused by people but you can’t get rid of the trouble. It is
safe that you get the trouble from people rather than getting it from something else which
might be even worse than that. People cause trouble and the effect can be worse than you have
imagined. If you try to be scared of it, then you can’t get rid of it. I will follow you in any other
way as possible in a different form you might have not expected. Trouble is a constant man.
What if you really don’t give a damn about the trouble ? You got me ? Say you have made a sin
which kills you every day. It is a big deal for you and that troubles you a lot. Is it really a sin ?
Who has created a rule that says the stuff you have done is a sin ? No it ain’t. It's just simple stuff
you did. It's all up to you whether you are categorizing it to sin or not. Don’t give a damn thing
to sin folk. Don’t care about trouble. You just killed almost everyone because they are causing
you trouble ? Have you ever tried to think of killing the trouble in the first place ?? you have
partial control over the cause but whatever the effect may be, you still can ignore it and don’t
care about it. But there are people who don’t care about the cause itself. They are the aloof folks.
Yes there are two types of folks out there in the town. The one who ain’t care about the cause
and the one who ain’t care about the effect. The first one can be aloof. He is not forcing himself
to live like that. He does that willingly. The second one likes to do stuff and doesn't care about
the effect. They live with people and still they are with the law. For both types of town folks, not
giving a damn care is common. You need to decide in which part of cause and effect you are ain’t
gonna care.
