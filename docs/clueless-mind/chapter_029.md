It is really
hard to break up with a friend. It is an awkward thing and doesn’t seem to be a serious one. It is
even harder when they are of the same gender. It has to be accepted from the other side as well.
We just can’t ignore it and let it pass. I did recently and failed.
Why don't they even consider a solo fella as a person? Wherever you go solo, they don’t see and
place you as a last priority. I was dining in a restaurant and this guy just forgot that I existed.
And it is useless to quarrel and leave an empty stomach.
Apple's sound recognition is an utter flop one.
Things that I was realising last year are happening in reality. I'm glad and not glad.
Past prioritise things that made you awkward, ashamed, embarrassed and little, big shitty things
that you did. Overall it is a shit. So ignore it.
Death is smooth if life doesn't create any problems.
People should mind their own business and stop creating problems or troubling others. If they
pass then they can enter into resurrection and stuff else what is the use of them ?
What will happen if the problem of the country is resolved. ? Any chance that it may get
resolved in future ? I feel like countries need an enemy to run in peace. Else they suffer.
I learned a lot about feminine from my queen cat.
The funny thing is that we eventually forget pain, how painful it really was.
