Chapter 5: It was about the general backstory and his colleague an about natasya’s growing up
and how she suddenly become strange that the general wifes know about this and it was at the

115
moment the general used myshkin and left to his story for the natasya stuff. And the general's
wife and her daughters were curious about myshkin that he was telling about the execution and
stuff.
Chapter 6: The mother and daughters were discussing the executions and he told about the
children of the village, and how people treat marie, Maire was cheated by a French man. When
she returned back home, her own mother didn’t care about her. Two months later her mother
died, and for the two months she didn’t speak to marie. Post that the villagers and childredna nd
everyon started to hate her. And myshkon met her, sold his diamond pin and gave stuff. He
kissed her and the children saw this. The village came to know about this. Mykshin tried to
make things clear on stuff. Slowly the came to understand. Children visit his palace. He tells
them stories about marie. Marie worked with the herdsman. And she died. Children praised
her. And this he tells the gang about their face and stuff. It was a nice read though.
Chapter 7 : Post that myskin reveals the natasya face to the gange and the mother got excited
and asked to grab it from ganya, who was out and ganya thought myskin had revealed all the
sacred stuff and got sacred. The mother asked the ganya to come and enquired about his
marriage, and to that he nodded no and it was recorded. Before this, when ganya handover the
photo to myskin, he gave a letter that needs to handed over to agleia, to which it was succeeded
and upon the mother went away, aglia, myskin and ganya were there and to reply to the letter
she didn't, and that was the conversation about and both went to ganya house
Chapter 9: All members in Ganya’s house assembled. The mother and sister were curious about
the decision for the day as nastasy was about to relieve what is gonna happen, and ganya starts
to scold and stuff. And all of sudden when myskin was about to exit, he came to see Nastasya.
She was inside. Having conversation. Ganya's father came. He told the lapdog story. That the
two lady irritate by his cigarette, where they throw the cigarette out and for that the father
throws the dog out and later came to know about this is the princess that the general's wife said
to myskin to get introduced and also nastasya told that the exact stuff she read five years back in
a magazine.
Chapter 10:
So this chapter is about at the ganya house house the gang includes are mushk will be seeing
those two guys on the train right so they all came without that ganya is going to marry nastocia
so they came and he will be revealing that to ganya and masters I will tell no and what happened
next this happened and slapping myshkin and nastaya went out and stuff.
Chapter 11 so this chapter is all about what happens if g a n y a and mushkil where having
conversation and it becomes more than and talking about nastasya. And about her character and
stuff and Kolya receives a letter from his father to meet him.
Chapter 12 so in this chapter what mushkil do is he have a conversation the general and never

saying and nastays base stuff is that she asked the prince whether to marry ganya or not and he
said no. and that was her decision. All shocked and now comes the rogozhin gang of 12.

We were having a discussion on a topic where it involves prime time.
People were so good at what they were doing and got succeeded and at some point, it reflected
to the public. The public, so called common people, consume its essence, pick it up and start to
work on it, to achieve the same level of success and that was their prime time. To focus on one
thing, work on them, till you get fulfilled which won’t make you realise what we are really doing
these many years. What I'm trying to convey is that people should admire the stuff they do,
enjoy the pleasantness it gives when it is fulfilled rather than feeling about their past actions
which gives them a disguise.
I was talking with my wife about this. Every human (from my point of view) has the bad
thought that they feel worried about not succeeding. For them, success is not in their timeline. I
was telling her that success is a chunk. One should realise it then and there in order to
accomplish the passion they are taken in their hand and no matter what the consequence is all
about but if a human who has figure out what he wants to do in their life itself is a successful
stuff, that this one moment of realisation will keep them in sync till the end. It is a feeling of
success now that long last as there is not a threshold where one can achieve and call it a success,
and if one does, then it is not, according to my view.

119
It's September 2nd, and tomorrow is our 1st year anniversary. Looking back in these month, I
got to know that how we were passionate about our things that we never let it go, that we were
constantly work on them parallelly, without sacrificing it at any matter, and with this process,
we learnt new stuff from each other that I feel that i’ve already succeeded in this life. And that
being said, that doesn't mean that I'm gonna get rid of my passion, and look for a new one to
consume the taste of success. It is always a big chunk of passion, where we are constantly
working on its branch and at one point of time, the chunk looks majestic yielding fruits and
shades and stuff.
I'm glad that I’m a successful person even though it was not approved by the third person who
doesn't know the spelling of my first name. Why should we even care about their opinion? It is
the self realisation on these matters and the passion and interest towards the big chunk is all that
matters.
