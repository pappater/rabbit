# Chapter 5

I was walking
on the sidewalk and a scene brought me attention to it. It was an ant taking dry leaves to
somewhere I don't know where. I was brooding over it for quite a long time and wondered why
this creature is designed to do this ?
And I thought after heading to my stay where I have a spider here and I call him Yosarrian. Of
old yossarian is too designed to stick in a wall for a very long time and if you want to know the
truth, I wonder from where it gets food and dont he just starve to death if he sticks there for a
week even not moving a little bit. Then I thought of the human. That's me who resides inside
that very room where Yossarian stays. How I was designed to do stuff. All I was doing is just
stuff that the brain is currently holding something. If my brain currently holds the stuff to read
books, I read books. If it holds to walk, I walk. If it holds to brood at something I just do the
same. What it makes me do. It's just people doing some crazy stuff in their life. Even from birth
till death like the ant taking the dry leaves. The thing is that it should be considered as the stuff
that our brain tells us to do. It's not a bad or good stuff. It's just stuff. Now my brain just holds
“who the hell actually decided this is bad or good stuff”. Is that the same brain that decides ? If so
then it has to be human consciousness that tells good or bad. or some other human seeded
human brain by categorising the stuff you do either by good or bad. In both cases you can feel
what is good and bad. Then I must say here there is no sin or karma stuff to interfere in this
design. There is no sin or karma. It's just people doing stuff. It doesn't matter whether it's good
or bad.
Here my brain tells me strongly not to believe in KARMA or SIN.

People.
The river is flooded with people. Hundreds of people.
The source of the river is always unexplored. It gets ruined when it is explored. It is a wonderful
stroke of luck, if it is explored and yet not ruined. It was such a kind of village. Tea. It is not
essential for survival. But becomes one if it is addicted. It is the second most popular drink in
the world.
It was eight past half and still the sun hadn't shown up. An empty trunk with a parallel yellow
beam is sailing toward the village to vacate the people from the village to the champ. The tea
plantation was dead. People moving to work on the tea plantation near champ.
