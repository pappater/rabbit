The haste
rickshaw.
The haste family. The Haste wind. Lay the unconscious daughter on the shoulder of the mother.
The mother was one among the family. The haste is towards the hospital. To get treatment for
her unconscious daughter bitten by the venomous snake. The family includes uncle, aunties and
old neighbourhood lady.
The family member from the rickshaw with the unconscious daughter by the mother's shoulder
was stopped by the hospital receptionist. It was said that the doctor was supposed to be available
at that time but he had a personal emergency and he is off. The worried family returned the
rickshaw.
The driver took them to another nearby hospital which is three kilometers away. It was midday
and it was hot. The rickshaw driver pulled it to maximum acceleration and flowed through the
street. The hot wind makes everyone sweat and tired. Their eyes withered with worries. The
closed eyes of the unconscious daughter made the mother too sober. She wailed all the way on
the rickshaw.
When they reached the hospital they were told that the doctor will be in half an hour. Since the
next nearest hospital is more than thirty kilometers away and the uncertainty of the doctor’s
availability, they decided to wait for the doctor to come. It is worse to wait with a dying
daughter by the hand. The whole hospital was echoed with the mother’s wail. She is praying to
the god, known and unknown. Her face too started writhing. She was the centre of attraction at
that scene. Her worries slowly started to spread to all those who came for treatment. Everyone
worried about the daughter. The men rushed to the reception to check for the doctor. It
disappointed them.
After an hour of wailing, the mother saw the doctor coming. She rushed to him holding her
daughter and told what had happened in a wailing tone. The doctor asked her not to worry and
took to his cabin.
The mother's known and unknown god answers her prayer with positive. She hailed all the
gods and the doctor and returned home with her conscious daughter.
