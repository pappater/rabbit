# Chapter 14

I always
wanted
to live in a tiny room. A Cozy one. Since I have been travelling for the past four years and out of
my home town without having a permanent place, I couldn't make one such. It was not a plan
either. But this quarantine cleared the path to establish something similar. Initially the room
was empty with a bed and cot. As I thought about getting out the old stuff from the store room,
I could identify some stuff that could be put out for a showcase. Since my roomies are not to my
taste I was diverted to place all those stuff in my room which holds only a bed and cot before.
Gradually I got into this thing. Even though people ain’t liked this much, I just put stuff I liked
and it was engaging as well. The dim light, 24/7 music, cozy, fish, cat, keyboard, harmonica,
typewriter and the wall, that's my living space in short.
