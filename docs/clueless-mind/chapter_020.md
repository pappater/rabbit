# Chapter 20

I was
discussing
with people what the hell is happening in North korea. Why they are so secretive and why
people didn’t rebel against it if they didn’t like the leader. I was reading an article in BBC about
the history of korea formation after the second world war. The north part of Korea is ruled by
the communist Soviet Union and the south by non-communist US. After the Independence
from Japan, both the regions splitted based on these philosophies. Further reading on the
nuclear weapon stuff, the three generation of ruled from the same family, the gap between the
north and south korea leader meetup, the US view on NK, the thread by NK, the failed and
useless missile demo by NK, the peace treaty between japan, the meetups of leader, both japan
and US, they tweet chatting between both the leaders of US and NK, the secret phone line
between KIM to US white house, the disable of the phone line, the visit of trump to NK, the
friendly chat between them and the whole article looks like reading catch-22 novel. It is funny
and in the end still North Korea seems to be a mysterious serious nation.
