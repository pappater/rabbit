# Chapter 59

101
The tress that
was panned and revealed the rivers and stuff and the movies is the package of documentaries of
the historical Hiroshima bombing and how the post war protest against it. The revelation of
suffering and pain from the past is beautifully crafted and delivered. It was the finger that played
all through the film and told its story. The ever blinking of Japanese shop banner lights tell the
parallel story of the city.
