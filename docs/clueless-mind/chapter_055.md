It was my
first road trip after getting a Yamaha FZ FI. I was cruising at a maximum of 80 kmph and the
mileage seems to be good. For a full tank fuel capacity of 13 Litres gave around 600 km of ride
and both highway and inside the city traffic. Captured photos and recorded some events of
people's talks.
The tea shop fella was witnessing the live accident and his explanation.
The truck drivers teachings at SriPerumbudur
The mates talk at the Gudiyatham, Palar river
Fake flower decorated face fella at Chittoor border
