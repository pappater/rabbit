# Chapter 6

Right now we
are the best form of us. What we do now is a damn experienced decision from us. It is perfect. It
is flawless. It is fascinating. Right now. Yet this very fascinating thing just fades from our
memory eventually. And it will look like the most embarrassing stuff that you have done in your
life. When you think of this years later.
What will be the result, if we stay at the very point, which our brains tell us, we are genius, our
decision is perfect and so on. The same brain tells that it was the greatest shit ever happened on
this earth. So obviously, the stuff which you are doing is gonna be shitty in future. So don’t give
any damn about it.
It doesn’t matter how our work end result looks. Each and every result has its own audience.
Some of your shitty work might be liked by millions. Some of your billion dollar ideas might
sucks except you. I don’t have any faith in the existing seven of me but there exists a million
people who might like my shitty work. The blockage here is they ain’t know that I have made
this shits and they don’t have enough brain that their brain will agree to my shitty work.
If people from the eighteenth century look at our works of art and science and stuff. They just
piss on your face. Yet those shitty works of art and science and stuff have an audience. People get
used to shitty stuff. That is how the earth works. Get used to shitty. Some people from the
twentieth century like eighteenth century shits and vice versa. Everywhere you see, you see shit.
Pick wisely or let your head pick it for you. It is actually for you. Don’t give shit what others say
shit about the shit you have chosen. It is your shit. It belongs to you.
