# Chapter 32

It was a
rightly balanced spectacle that was hanging at the tip of the nose and the temple end of it was
rightfully placed at the ears steep so that it made the viewers betting on whether it would fall or
not. It was the old man's first impression that he was sitting on the third row, second seat,
holding a device that ran android os and swiping through the screen like a snail absorbing each
and every detail of the post from social media. Nothing reflects on his face as it was the same for
whatever he does.
And the staring was continued for hours and the information that was thrown as input and it
was processed and yielded its result which was again nothing was shown on his face and moved
to the next content which is of a text post with three line about a political division that was not
yet confirmed but was a guess, assumed something from the future which was not in creator of
the post hand or the actually political leader hand since the leader that supposed to make the
decision gave the control to lord krishna to decide on the division of the party and hence it is in
the hands of krishna to decide on the assume post by some unknown party member who
actually assumed something to gain some popularity and attention which can be act as a feed for
his future political journey which is also an assumed one.
The old man with the loosely hanging spectacle staring at this assumed content and thinking of
some events and emotions in his head that was not revealed through his face but some serious
process is happening deep inside on his head. His processing events is of again an assumption
and the emotion is of type jealousy. The event is that the assumed post creator might gain much
popularity and may be called by the party headquarters and was allocated to some low level
position and as the time passed, his extraordinary talent in bribery and connection with other
party members helped him to contest in the election and became a minister of transport and
within few short term period he was chosen to be a temporary CM in case if the actually CM
caught in the act of illegal law and order, thereby the temp can get replaced. To the old man's
overthinking, the actually CM actually got arrested for scamming in land acquisition of the salt
harvest flats where he registered to his name and constructed a salt guest house surrounded by
salt and sea water from bay of bengal assumed that it is not that big deal to do so which
backfired resulted in getting arrested and the temperrory CM (the content creator of the assume
post about the political division) was appointed as the actual CM and soon he became the
permanent one as people just ignored and forgot the previous CM who was arrested over the
salt land scam.
This series of assumed thoughts by the old man led to the jealousy that he was suffering inside
but was not revealed publicly and as he was aware that nothing can be done over this
assumption that he moved to the next post which is of a video where thousands of party
members welcomed the party leader. Thus again the series of assumed events and jealous

emotioned rooted into the old man's mind and that is how he spent his time till one in the
morning until he closed his eyes to sleep.
