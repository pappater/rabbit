A DAY AND
THE FAMILY
The clap echoed, their presence was showcased, and the entrance they were entering was
decorated with lights and roses and people who were welcoming the other people for the event.
All of sudden, their expression changes by seeing the new gang entering, by clapping their hands
and hesitation for a while whether to let them inside or not. Fear made them do nothing and the
gang entered into the marriage hall with intense clapping. The transgenders, on the stage, were
blessing the bride and groom, got their reward, and left without saying anything. It was their
first such event, both for the transgenders and the marriage event people. Outside, few young
people were playing football and watching the transgenders coming out, still clapping, and one
of the transwomen made a wink at a boy, who looked handsome, and smiled at him as if to
seduce him. He blushed and feared. And ran over to his home.
It was raining intermittently and the subway was protected with the blue semi circle shield, in
order to conceal the rain water stagnation. The rail, which was halted for half an hour finally got
its signal and it started its journey towards the west. Kollidam is showing off its cruelty and the
silver beach blurting out her history of chaos and stuff. It seems that it is a normal thing to take
vengeance on the next village; and the village goes back to sadness if not any such stuff
happened for the enemy village. Hence is the routine for both the villages to trigger the event
that resulted in vengeance and stuff that hold the pride in that, and thus that is how the
generation were fed with the purpose of their lives. And it was one of those events where there
was wailing at the house, in front, knowing her husband was killed and melted at the sea, was
crying with the neighbour holding two of her children side by side. She, sick of such an event
and the silliness, moved far away from the place with her sons to the town. And she was
blurting those past events to the new neighbourhood. On revealing those past sadness, a lot of
emotions which were unknown to them were revealed, making them sad and inferior and
struggling to mingle with the new town mates.
It was the elder son, who was on a bike, in search of coffee shop, alone and scared, was passing
the head post office, and found a old little dirty shop, hesitated, cancelled the intention for
having coffee, took right turn, passing the governing buildings and stuff and stopped near a
stream, grazing the tharaipalam. Its wail made him sad. He sat watching its flow and
remembered his past and the darkness crowded his soul as people were wailing at that time,
when his father was killed and thrown into the sea. Maybe this steam will reach the same ocean

and may wail to his dead father, he thought. He remembered how stunned he was when he
heard the news and the strange feeling that occupied him, and how he didn’t cry a bit, but
everyone, the known and unknown faces were crying and wailing for the disappearance of his
father. Is he dead or eloped ? Why am I not crying ? Am I that much of a rude son ? Why can’t I
act like them ? Why is no one asking me to cry ? Am I invisible ? My soul is invisible ? His
baseness was making him suffer and all of the sudden the whole class people came from his
school, with the teacher and stuff. When he saw them, he cried and tears dropped down and the
whole school gang accompanied him without consoling him and letting his emotion drain along
with the people surrounding him. He was back to present, hesitated watching this tharaipalam,
and the dark past event, got up, ignited the bike and returned home.
The new town and people did not impact, for the elder one. He didn’t feel anything post the
dark phase. He wanted new alternation and focus, to make his life move one. They didn’t sleep
the first day at the new town and new home. After some chaotic thought and unable to bear
those emotions, scared with the thought, they slept frightened, the two sons. But the mother
wanted the night to stretch long as she got the night only, a solitude one, with her thought, was
in struggle with the past sadness and the future horror-ness, that was continuously altering in
her mind, and her tears soaked the pillow. The tiredness of the body and the eye, triggering her
to get rest but she was afraid to sleep. She wants the night to suffer with those horrible
thoughts. It was a safe place for her to handle those thoughts. The morning was bright and
sound with the street traffic and stuff, and she hesitated on why she got up, releasing all those
dark ones all at once, and wishing the day would pass soon, for the night, to handle the thought
again. The sons were ready for school and she, for time being, was distracted with the thought
and focus on the sons, feeding and the positive future of the son's life. The boys too were
positive with the new day.
She winked, the lower left corner of the lip twisted and animated and the iris half shut by the
eyelid, and to upgrade more of this seductiveness, few thin lines of dark black hair screened in
the left part of the face and danced as it reflected how his soul conditioned. She got up from the
stop, rock under the banyan tree and moved to the back side. He too got up, without winking,
and followed her face and she disappeared back of the tree. With intention to not to leave her
face a moment, rushed, and with the intention to seek the continuation of seduction, he
happened to see a big pond with lilies and lotus. His flow of thoughts got stopped and on search
where she was, there she stand behind him, and blurted out a hard laugh of cunningness and
stuff and the face slowly forms into male feature of moustache and beard that wears saree, and
the base voice of laughing intensified to gave him a chill moment of discussing, and she now
become a trans woman. He got up from his dream, the younger son hesitated, nodded, settled,
drank water and lay still on his bed and remembered the morning event with the transwoman.
