The morning
thought
was on people debate over the definition and leaving off the point that they are intent over the
conversation. It is as if they draw a conclusion of a new point of view to a specific word and
restrict their thought to not to go beyond that and put the two points of view and put in front
and the fight is done to which side the support is high and how well the view is put forward and
so on. The definition is merely a baseline to improvise it and to name it in whichever way it is
wanted as it is merely man made stuff. The conversation gets its beauty when the detail over the
word is added on. For instance if the question is asked whether or what is god, the people would
be blurting out the instant definition that they were taught in some period of past and not a
second of thinking about what has been put forward, and it is something a conditioned
definition. And instead, what impact does believing in god make humans to not kill this absurd
concept which even they know the truth in but aren't willing to not to believe that it is fake and
a manmade concept. If the conversation goes in such a manner, then it is not a debate over the
known fact but the newly born thought over this newer question that put forward and it is
improvised in a manner that it may look madness at some point but it was the truthness the
only the people who involved in it will understand and upon telling in non sync manner to the
people, it looks absurd and nullity.
And how beautiful, the different point of view one put forward. If the intention is not debated,
then one would be in ecstasy over the point of view, how bliss it was, how elegant the way it
was put and stuff.
And is it possible to be in sync with the group with the same mentality to be making the
conversation is so absurd. It is the way it was preferred by nothing in reality that happened as a
person preferred. It was what it was and accepted and moved on.
Why is getting a tip considered cheating for oneself, refusing to provide even though the service
is proper ? The Traffic policeman in the busy hour, was in urgent need of using the restroom of
the hotel and none questioned as it was basic stuff to not to care and it was the same hotel where
the service is not proper yet a tip is demanded. Is it something inner self telling to not provide
any reason unknown. Who is that actually ? It is not the true self. All of sudden it reaches
oneself and in a zone, an extraordinary thing gets executed or a very basic stuff on the contrary
and nothing to blame the self as it seems it is not responsible for something that happened

without consciousness. It is like someone’s soul, that was roaming there, got into the body and
acted differently out or nowhere, made the self to wonder and admire and in expectation to
occur the same in future and get disappointed.
