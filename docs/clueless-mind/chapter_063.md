Panruti, Feb
03, 2024.
It was early in the morning, waiting at the bus stand, watching over the buses nameboards that
might look interesting to travel for the day. Whenever i travel via panruti and vadalur route, the
under construction road work was still incomplete for the past three plus years. And this time, it
was still under construction. At the junction where it beams out the clock tower and the arch,
that always looks familiar to me as I visited the same place a year back, roamed the street, had a
dinner over the corner food stall and went to the next town concluding that there was nothing
to see. And this time, I went to the bus stand, photographed people and stuff and got settled into
a bus that was destined to Pillaiyarkuppam. Before the next sequel, I would like to jot an
interesting incident that happened at the junction where the clock tower was beaming high and
the arch. The old man selling tender coconut was in conversation with another fella where in
his last night was ruined by three rats, where he threw away two rats and with vengeance, he
twisted the last rat's head and body and with the struggle, the rat bites the index finger and left
the world and died. He was seeking medical guidance and the fella responded to find a
drumstick tree and bite them. He nodded and probably he was on his way to do that now.
Coming back to the Pillaiyarkuppan bus, it was filled quickly by the school people demanding
their routine seat and it was given back to them. I jumped to the next bus standing parallel to it
and its name board is Kedilam. Boarded. I was sitting in the window seat. Watching over the
scenarios and stuff and photographing some.
At Kedilam, it was a cross road, intersected with the national highway 45. At the bus stop, there
are 7 men doing nothing, killing their boredom by watching the passers and stuff and few
scrolling their mobile phone to speak to someone. Infront a flower shop was installed and a cat
is sitting next to the owner where it was vibing cooling over there. I photographed them. Passed
the subway and it held a small temple, a garland shop, and a tiny tiffin shop. They were
quarrelling among themself to some stuff.
At Villupuram, at 12 in the noon, the book fair speech is being echoed in the town centre. By
hearing it, I just realised that it is more of public speaking than the content and stuff. Inside the
book fair, it was a simple one, not many shops had been installed there, but I bought three
books. They were Tamil novels. While returning to maruvathur, was reading Vaadivasal, a

short novel. Near me was a guy who was having a group call, troubling other peoples life in the
name of solving the issue. It is better to cross those stuff early in the age.
