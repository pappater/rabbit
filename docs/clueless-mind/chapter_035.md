The ground
was
green and home for the dog family. They play nicely day and night and hunt when they hunger.
They were barking at the crowd one day as the humans were seen with the measuring tape. At
night on the same day, the hunt was over and they were playing what seemed like a dancing
ceremony. The sunshined again and a wailing accompanied them. The JCB cleared the ground
for construction of a human home. The wailing gradually faded and the dogs moved out in
search of a new home.
