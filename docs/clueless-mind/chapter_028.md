# Chapter 28

48
I opted for
Natgeo Magazine two months back and I read about a lot of problems that the world is facing.
For the last three issues, I can see there existed an African issue. And Africa was a good place to
live before colonization. It is a good place to live because no one knows about the place and
people ain’t care about the money and living with domestic and wildlife. Even if they kill wildlife
for safety purposes, that doesn't make any animal a rare species. When the colonisation was
happening, the country was looted and people became poor and sufferers. If the resources of
Africa were used properly then it would have become like a gulf nation. They had oil and
African people had gold, diamonds and other valuable resources. They were looted without
giving credits.
Why I’m pointing this out is that from last month's issue, there was a cheetah smuggling article
that states the illegal exporting of cheetahs to the gulf region. People just do that for money's
sake. If at all the colonization did any good to those people, they wouldn’t do that for living.
Moreover still all the wildlife smuggling are exported to top tier counties and gulf which still
they are looting.
I can see nat geo mag has been in the market for 200 years and all these years they just tell the
world what is happening there in africa, how animals are killed for ivory, horn and stuff but
they don't care who is doing that and no one is talking against them. There may be some stuff
that might go against them. What are their impacts ? Still they just live a luxurious life and here
people are just doing illegal stuff for food. Just do it all for just food.
Reporting the suffering does not help. Need to fix the root. Need to control the greediness of the
top tier countries and people. Without fixing them and just giving temporary solutions to
Africa won't help.
