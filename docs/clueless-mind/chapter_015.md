# Chapter 15

27
I have mixed
feelings about this novel. The three volumes tell the different phases of the little boy who deals
with a broken heart, disappointment, enlightenment and a lot more stuff. The character that
spends time in and around with the protagonist is also clear and straight to the point. And
wemmick of a simple character who lived in his little arbour and his simple life which attracts
me more. The novels tell the consistency of the character again like how it portrays sense and
sensibility. The final few chapter made heartache and it looks some time to coming back to
reality and the last line of the novel still echoing in my heart. This happens in everyone's life.
We alway expect something in our life without knowing what we are expecting and most of
them end with disappointment. Even doing good to people is of an expectation and most of the
time it ends with disappointment. The consistency is a very needed one. No matter how you
change your character to its best or worst, there comes a base of your character which may be
good or bad and obviously you will be settling to it at that end. And one cannot tell there ain’t
love. If that is blurted out, then it was a lie. Anyhow people have to face it like jealousy. It's a
good read.
GREAT EXPECTATION
