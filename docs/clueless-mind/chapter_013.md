The good
thing
about being born during the 80s and 90s is that we witness the major change from one
generation to another. Never in history had this kind of change. Or it might have taken place
slowly. 90s born had most of the stuff in physical form. The big Cathode ray tube TVs, Radio
FM, Walkman, Telephone, Typewriter, Cassette player, Calculator, Compass, Maps and so on. It
feels so connected with us. And the beauty is that we care about them a lot. No matter what
worse the output it may produce, it just satisfies us. The jamming of the typewriter, the rolling
sound of the cassettes, click of button, fm tuning distortion. Even though it was not all perfect,
we didn’t get irritated by these kinds of drawbacks. It engaged us with vibes. How cool it is to
trek with physical maps and compasses. Or just exploring some remote places with the maps.
Identifying the spot and getting the destination. Two years back, I just explored a town using
the physical map. Getting it out in print and exploring. It felt damn hard to locate and get to the
destination. For a single town, I took almost 20 different locations of the town by zooming at
maximum. Earlier days, when people travel long, they just calculate the geographical map in
their mind and just ask local people help for the navigation if they struck somewhere. It was fun
to do that. People do this stuff now but only if google map algorithm took them to some
abandoned rice mill. The show is telecasted on TV now by all town and village people.
Reviewed by them. Since the shows are less, it is valued more. The same applies to FM as well.
In my native village, we used to listen to FM where we get Ceylon FM signals. Now we have
tons of FM on the internet but who is listening ?
It sounds ridiculous for some folks as this doesn't make any sense. But there are some people
who are just willing to stick with this kind of lifestyle. I'm one among them. And I'm trying hard
to replicate them now as well.
When Apple launched the iPhone back then, everyone welcomed the change as no one thought
it would kill a lot of devices. And Apple didn’t care about that as well. Back in the 80s, TV was
considered bad. Because it controls people. People from the top level, tell the people what they
want to think via broadcasting. People just followed them blindly. The same is happening with
the phone which we use now but in a more severe way. All those services are available in a
single device and we just use them without any connection. And it just controls us what to do.
This incident happened recently. I was just driving with my friend and we were discussing some
restaurant But didn't intend to visit. We just navigated to some other hardware shop which is

totally opposite to the restaurant and blindly took the route, it just took us to the restaurant
which we were discussing in the car. We had dinner there.
Maybe the latest technology made everything possible, but it lessened the value of it. Anyone
can get stuff easily nowadays. Back then if we wanted to listen to a new song, we had to wait
and listen to them. Can't repeat them, to memorise the lyrics in a time frame. To Memorise the
tune and so on. It is inconvenient, but they are so connected.
Recently,I tried to get back all those 90s stuff either in working condition or not and managed
to get some of the mechanical devices in working condition like typewriter, metronome. I
couldn't find electrical stuff like a cassette player, walkman, radio, crt tvs, in working condition.
Some people still have this stuff. But when I tried to get them at this point of time, I couldn't get
them as easily as buying a phone online.
