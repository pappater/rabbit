# Chapter 12

Hi, I'm Amare.
I was born in Irbit, a town in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia, located 203 kilometers from
Yekaterinburg by train or 250 kilometers by cart, on the right bank of the Nitsa. The town was
known by different names during different eras and when I was born it was known previously
by Irbeyevskaya. My father was the wing commander for the Russo-Japanese War. He died
when I was about to print my footprints on the black earth.
My mother is a peasant. I love her.
It was the time of crawler tractor evolution. The poor fellas ain’t paid enough. The landlords are
getting back the land from the poor. It was said as the reason as the village people are debted to
banks. If the explanatory questions were asked from villagers, they echoed it was banks lands.
Some farming families even vacated the village.
Me and Erasyl were playing around the dead tree. We were ten and like two peas in a pod. It
was summer and the day was hot. As usual, Me and
Erasyl along with his neighbourhood mates planned to
visit the dead tree and begin our daily routine. It was a
simple play. Tying four ropes on the dead tree center
and circulating by gripping our hands on it and at a
particular tempo which makes us fly above the ground.
It goes on till we get tired. If parched, we go to the
mammoth well at the end of the rye. It is huge and
petrified. It serves as the single most source of water to
the whole village.
Erasyl is a coward. It is easy to get him scared even
with the ant. But it was the one thing that we all are
scared of. It is the Zever, the oxen. It ain’t like a normal
one. He is the Spiniensis, the god of thorns. His eyes is
alway looking for vengeance. His thorn faces sharp at
us when he sees the ground. Curious how he renders us
in his eyes. He obeys only to Kwame, an old man, his
owner who takes care of Zever from childhood. Kwame
is like a roman emperor Caligula who loved one of his horses, Incitatus, so much that he gave
the steed a marble stall, an ivory manger, a jeweled collar and even a house. Though he ain’t got
any ivory jewellery, he made his barn like the one.
(Me and Erasyl turned 17)

It was dusk and the pinkish sky turned into the dark clouds with the twinkling stars. It was
disturbed day. Something unknown is bothering me inside. So many questions are echoing on
my header yet the answers are unknown. Why do poor people become even poorer but rich yet
much richer ? They are nothing without us yet they have all the powers. I don’t like mama not
being paid what she deserves at this age. It applies to all those elderly people on the fields. I was
looking up at the sky and asking for advice.
I heard the rail engine chucking its smoke on this murky night. The sound gradually increased
and it echoed deep inside my head.
It was the end of winter and I felt the advancing spring. Me and Erasyl and the dead tree friends
gathered. Isabis and Jafari are among the crowd who had been to Moscow and told us there are
machines that replace humans in the field. A crawler tractor has been used for farming. We
decided to buy one and use it on our farm. It was not believed by the Landlords. They thought it
was the myth that such a thing doesn’t exist.
We travelled back to Moscow and bought an engined tractor for ploughing. The entire village
was waiting for our arrivals. Ma, Kwame, Zever witnessed the arrival of the machine. The
engine suddenly stopped. We know to start that thing but not to repair it. Later we came to
know the fuel was drained. We refilled and started again. The whole village regained happiness.
The landlord's son, who is our age, disliked the machine we bought. The jealousy rooted in him
resulted in the killing of poor Isabis. Everyone in the village knows the landlord's son killed
Isabis. When we took the coffin the whole village cried and we buried Isabis under the Yew tree.
It was the death of Isabis that was bothering me now. Even I didn't feel this weird feeling as I
got when Isabis was killed. It was queer.
Later in the midst of winter, ma died. I couldn’t express the feeling. I followed the hearse all the
way back to the graveyard where Isabis was buried. We buried ma in a traditional way.
It was void. It felt like when someone held your hand and suddenly left you in the midst of the
crowd and didn't know what to do next in your life. I struggle deep inside. I feel like staying
alone at home. Erasyl came a couple of times. Knocked the door. And he went back. The candle
was not lit for months, I did not know whether it was day or night. Madame Anastasia, Ma’s
closest friend, visits home and cooks for me. She didn’t spell a word. She left me alone.
Erasyl visits home after two and half months. I nodded at everything he told me. When he got
up, he handed me a book which was inscribed on the cover as Doctor Zhivago. I started reading
with a lit up candle. It diverted me a little. I read more books. The shelf got filled.
The astounding knowledge the books have turned me to write something on the paper that
strikes my head. Whenever I dozed off, I started writing poetry. Of people, of nature, of culture,

21
of troubles, of wonders, of lunatics, of eerie, of all the varied emotions that I felt during
solidarity. This urge of poetry makes me move outside of the house. I visited markets, streets.
Meeting people of different cultures. Observed the inner and external things and turned them to
poetry.

The
machinery
sounds
crowded in the day room. It was a stormy day, a cyclone was on its way to hit the lighthouse.
The people dismantle the roof to safeguard it from the high wind that moves 120km/hr. The
media overflows with this news to each and every house in the town. The government is taking
tremendous action to save lives from the coming disaster. The election is going to happen in
another six months. People forget themselves and merge them with these electoral campaigns.
And it was some strange feeling that rooted within him. He wishes this strangeness to last for
some more time. This strangeness gives him ideas, creativity, peace and to be alone by himself.
He thinks being alone makes him greater than with people. If this works, then let him have this
as his motto. But this strange feeling seems to be partially helping. He clearly can’t see why this
feeling overwhelms him as well as makes him stand inside four walls stagnant in the same place.
The surrounding is filled with the stuff that he likes, yet his heart treats them as the enemy. The
word is the enemy. The room is filled with the old 80s funk music in its background. It adds to
the mood of the room that hangs the wall clock on the top right corner where a female mask
hangs aside to the left. The scent took his mind to the ghats he trekked two years back. When he
returns back to reality, he hates it. A laughing buddha laughs at him, the room plants giggling at
him, the lights emit a shadow, the old radio-player plays the song that irritates. He played some
more funk to go back to some non reality place. It took him back to the 70s-80s russian
landscape where people seem to live happily yet he found they suffer the same what he suffers
now. He approaches an old farmer in this non reality world to take some advice to survive in
reality. The old farmer wise words are inaudible to him. His non reality world is deaf and dumb.
He can see but deaf and dumb. He roams like a gypsy by not blurting a word to people and sees
the stuff on his way. It settles him down. It ain’t supposed to be a river or an ocean or a ghats or
rye but just exploring places makes him settle. He settled in the non reality world. When he
returns to reality, he follows the same to settle himself.

I was meeting some group of people in an old abandoned house surrounded by a sea salt
extraction field. Those people were not nice. This old place has strange statues and stuff but my
intuition told me not to take them home as I was so fond of them. There was some strange game
playing between the two groups in the basement of the building. It is like throwing a small teeny
tiny stone from the basement to the second floor. All the people were cheering them from the
second floor. I was there with them but did not belong to any team. It happened when one of
the other teams won the match which led to chaos. The staircase was blocked to escape.
Meanwhile, a good buffet is happening on the terrace. I went top and asked a fella to wrap some
food to have on the way back home. He seems strange. but he wrapped and gave me the food. As
the staircase was blocked I couldn't get down. Suddenly there was another staircase on the other
side. It was also crowded with a bunch of fellas but they were wailing loud which felt scary and
strange. I ignored them and came down and realised it was an old cemetery.
I took the exit and reached the nearby town. I was searching for a place to eat my food. Ain’t got
one. Suddenly I saw a bungalow with a big gate in the front and an old lady sitting on the front
door doing some strange actions. I asked her permission to dine in the lobby. she nodded. When
I came close and recognised her face, a stream of tears started to flow in me. I have seen the face
before and I have always wished to meet her and that made the stream of tears. It was phoebe
buffay from the friend series. I was astonished, shocked, and trembled. wailing as those fellas did
at the secondary staircase while escaping from the strange old building from the cemetery.
I told her that I admire her a lot. She was preoccupied with something else when I told her that I
admire her a lot. After a while she let me in. She introduced me to her friend. Her friend smiled
at me and we exchanged our hands. After some time the friend smiled at me. After sometime
again the friend smiled at me. And after sometime phoebe came. The friend then asked for the
rate. I ain’t got at first and later realised it was a prostitution. I was astonished, shocked, and
trembled. Wailing as those fellas did at the secondary staircase while escaping from the strange
old building from the cemetery again but this time it was for a different reason. When I tried to
escape the friend grabbed my stuff and the hand. Somehow I got my stuff and got down. But she
got my phone with her. The friend. I was looking at Phoebe but she didn't care and went inside
the hall. And here comes another strange figure. This time it was a fella. A big fat dark
non-smile greasy-hair brown-boot fella. A bad fella. I told them from the bottom that I got some
of their stuff and it will compensate for my loss. The fat fella got angry against me and grabbed
his brown boot and it was flying in the air to hit me. I acted like I was running away from the
greasy-hair fella. The big fat dark fella ran down the staircase to get me and it happened to meet
him so close and realise he was a big fat dark non-smile greasy-hair brown-boot PIG. He took a
knife from his pocket and in that time gap I hooked his face with some punch that made him
dizzy with the knife in his hand. He was trying to knock me by fapping his knife hand to his
leeward where it was empty. He was so dizzy at that time and I made him dizzy further and I
grabbed his phone and ran away from the bungalow. An old and greasy one.
