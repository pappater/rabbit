# Chapter 67

I was listening
to the audiobook Amma Vanthal. Initially, I was drawn in by the narration, and soon found
myself absorbed in the story. At first glance, it seems like a simple tale, but upon deeper
reflection, it delves into the mindset of people and how they react to certain situations.
Appu, the protagonist, is a scholar who remains unaware of many happenings around him, yet
he is rich in thought and pure in heart. The narration begins with Appu arriving at the banks of
the Kaveri River and reminiscing about his admission to a scholar’s school during his childhood,
where Bhavani Ammal was in charge. He was accompanied by his father, Thandapani. Bhavani
Ammal cared for Appu, teaching him the Vedas and other subjects. As his studies concluded,
Appu found himself reflecting on his past and future. Indhu, a young widow living with
Bhavani Ammal, begins to develop feelings for Appu.
When Appu decides to leave for Chennai to reconnect with his family and his mother,
Alangaram, Indhu expresses her affection for him, much to Appu’s shock and discomfort.
Unaware of her feelings before, he becomes irritated and leaves Tiruchy for Chennai to stay
with his mother.
Thandapani, a city clerk who also taught the Vedas to high-profile individuals in his spare time,
was regularly visited by Sivasu, a wealthy man seeking help with his horoscope. As the story
unfolds, it is revealed that Alangaram is having an affair with Sivasu. This revelation deeply
affects Appu. Alangaram had once hoped that by making Appu a scholar, she could atone for her
sins and seek forgiveness from him.
Later, Bhavani Ammal falls ill and writes to Appu, prompting him to return to Tiruchy to check
on her health. She decides to leave her house to Indhu and entrusts the school to Appu. Despite
all this, Appu chooses not to write back to his mother. One day, Alangaram visits, seeking
answers as to why Appu hadn’t written to her since returning to Tiruchy. Realizing that Appu
had not forgiven her, she plans a pilgrimage to Kashi to atone for her past actions.
Thoughts
I’ve outlined the main plot of the book above. However, when viewed from the perspective of
each character, the story takes on different nuances. The narrative centers around Appu’s
decision on where to settle after finishing his studies. His choice involves Indhu, who loves him
deeply, and the realization that he prefers the simplicity of village life over the city. This decision
is solidified when he learns of his mother’s affair.
From Indhu’s perspective, she fell in love with Appu even before her marriage. The death of her
husband, though tragic, gave her a sense of hope that she could finally express her feelings to
Appu.
Thandapani, despite knowing the truth about Alangaram’s affair, chose not to cause chaos or
drama.
Alangaram, even after deciding to redeem herself through Appu’s education, continued her
affair with Sivasu.

This story reflects the complex nature of human behavior. There is no clear distinction between
good and bad; people are often compelled by societal norms to follow a protocol. In truth, every
action stems from a person’s heart and desires. Humans are inherently designed by nature to
behave in this way. Nature bestows upon all living beings a set of instincts, but only humans
have the added complexity of labeling actions as “good” or “bad.” This labeling happens only
after the action is completed, and over time, it can create guilt, even as the actions persist.
Most of these actions aren’t connected to conscious decision-making. While it may seem like we
are in control of small choices, when viewed from a broader perspective, we simply repeat the
patterns of the past and future, regardless of what the Gita, Bible, or Quran says.

Every
country,
state, district, institution, and every fragment that involves a group of people aiming to
accomplish a task in a protective, less chaotic way chooses a template with rules and regulations
to make the task easy and smooth. The rules and regulations are stated, and those who engage
with these fragments are informed and proceed to be part of the group. It is the duty of the
individual to abide by these rules and regulations. If not, there are several actions that will be
taken as consequences. This is how I view laws or rules.
And my curiosity is, why were these laws introduced? The concept of law and order has existed
since ancient civilizations, with early legal codes like Hammurabi’s Code (Babylon, around 1754
BCE) aimed at ensuring justice and maintaining peace. Now, law and order have evolved rapidly
post-17th century, and in the name of creating a peaceful world, it has sometimes resulted in
unintended consequences, which they are now trying to fix. This is a different topic that I will
cover later on.
Now, what will happen if the rules are not followed? The foundation of all these rules and
regulations is built on fear. Even when I look at the holy books of religions, I see a set of rules
and regulations where the core point is: if these are not followed, the consequence will be
punishment. Hell is for the bad, and heaven is for the good. With the fear of being punished and
sent to hell, people follow good practices, and consequently, there exists some peace compared
to non-law periods. But whether society has truly found peace is another topic we won’t get into
now.
What happens if someone acknowledges the rules but not entirely, perhaps only 99%, while that
1% doesn’t align with their personal views? Should they abide by that 1% they dislike, or should
they ignore it? As a whole, the law should be followed, but each person has their own sense of
consciousness, which sometimes takes precedence over any law. But will this impact society or
the group they have chosen to work with? No, everyone has their own opinion and perspective.
One such case involves an IPS officer who, while pursuing an M.L., received 59.91% and filed a
case in the Madras High Court to round off the mark to 60%. The University of Madras denied
this request. What went wrong? Why did the university say no, and why did the officer file a
case in the first place? The results are grouped into First Class, Second Class, and Fail. Based on
the marks, the class is assigned. But how can we say that 59.91% is not First Class? Some people
blindly follow the rules and argue that if the mark is less than 60%, regardless of the decimal, it’s
Second Class. They might say that if the student wants 60%, they can rewrite the exam to get
more than 60%. On the other hand, some argue that it’s the range that matters, and 0.09% won’t

significantly impact eligibility in the class-based system. Competitive exams are where precise
numbers matter, and so on. Some argue that it is the university’s ego that led them to say no to
the High Court’s judgment. If society is built on rules and the university is a part of this system,
it should have abided by the judgment and rounded off the value to 60%. If it didn’t, according to
the classic concept of law, it should be penalized for failing to comply.
No one can definitively say what is right or wrong. Every individual has their own set of right
and wrong. Even the nations we live in are built on rules that not every individual has agreed
upon. There are always ups and downs. But the intention of law is to calm chaos and bring
about peace. To achieve this, the fundamental idea is to follow the rules. If an individual,
institution, or any fragment doesn’t like the rules and chooses a chaotic path, it is illogical. The
common assumption is that such acts are often associated with left-wing ideologies. But it’s not
just them—it exists within every individual. We often rebel based on the sense of rightness we
believe in, and others will be stubborn in their point as well. It’s human nature to rebel, but this
tendency has only been labeled as a left-wing trait. Even this point will be contradicted by many,
which is exactly what I’m getting at—everyone rebels.
What feels right is dharma.
