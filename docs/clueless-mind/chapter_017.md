“It is strange
how we hold on to the pieces of the past while we wait for our futures.”
Everything is rare and precious those days. I Watch a new release once a month. Eating biryani
once a year. Store songs in walkman are 10. Everything is limited but the kids just enjoyed the
stuff they had and they knew the value of it.
In the name of technology development, there came a sudden change in the regular stuff and we
people completely forget what we missed in the past that once was a great pleasurable thing.
