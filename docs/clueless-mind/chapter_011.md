# Chapter 11

Ain't got any
work to do. And I start this with Ain't because I liked to start something with ain't. I sat on the
sofa that is right aligned to the hallway and I'm the aloof two-legged species who sits in-front of
Mac at 00:28 under the knocking sound of the keypad. The giggling sound of crickets on the
higher octave with the moderate tempo that adds one more layer to the song that is already
humming in my mind. The Kinks were in a loop for a week. My looping count doubled because
the same lyric repeated multiple times in that song itself. The save button on Google Keep just
saves every bit of the word that I have typed to the cloud like someone is retyping it somewhere
else in the world.
