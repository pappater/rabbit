Kite runners,
an emotional roller coaster. I have read it slowly, hating that it is going to end. The good thing
about reading the world's literary books is that we can learn their cultural thing which is so
unique and each and everyone has a pride in their own culture which has been traditionally
followed for years. The pride is seen well in kite runners. It explores the afghan region, their
struggle, suffering, revolution, food, movie, immigration, and much more.
