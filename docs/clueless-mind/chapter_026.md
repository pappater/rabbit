# Chapter 26

Recently I was
watching a documentary series on Netflix. Sudden change in mood may lead us anywhere and
this time it took me to a Formula 1 race. There is a documentary called Formula 1 on Netflix
with 3 seasons of each 10 episodes. The series is all about politics, statistics, history, winning,
losing and so much stuff from the Formula 1 race for the past three years. Once you are fine with
the content, then you will be a fan of F1 races.
What I learnt from this ? Now I have started to watch F1. Today was a qualification round.
Going back to 5 years back, I like to get into the world of F1. I tried so hard to know what was
going on and wanted to keep in sync with the matches. But I was distracted by some other stuff
without knowing I was moving to others. I totally forgot I was interested in F1 until recently
when I saw the thumbnail on netflix. I was curious and clicked and watched and now I was in
sync with them. I don’t know how long I will be in sync but I am well connected with it. The
major difference between now and the five years back is the lack of basics. Without knowing an
inch of the stuff and trying to excel in it is a waste of time. It won’t work and it will make it
worse and make you feel you are useless. The impact of basics is realised when we are really
keen to know the basics.
Recently, I’m just rolling back my memories from my childhood and analyzing what I was not
good at and why I failed. It is simple that I was not aware of the basics and just went by the gut
and assumption. It is not always a failure. Some people, by going by guts and assumption, may
give them success as they are aware of what they are good at or something else that I'm not sure
about but for some people, the basics are important before getting started. Without the basics
we feel useless in the field we like to excel.
Advance and intermediate level in any skill is a byproduct of the basics. Without that aiming for
advanced and intermediate level is useless.
So no one is useless if they try to realise and learn the basics.
