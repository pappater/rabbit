Ideas are
rooted
from the past exposure with the sudden current knowledge which just connects and forms a
mental picture which tempts you. Such a thing happened today and I tried the tempting picture
in my mind and I'm totally happy with the outcome.
For the past few weeks, I was scribbling on my drawing notebook. I just found that I can't draw
stuff perfecting with lines and drawing knowledge. I concluded that those things are just a guide
to just replicate what's on our mind to the paper. I just tested my guide and it told me that you
just need to scribble to get things done. So I just cleared that path and started scribbling by
picturing some person from the movie and street and each and every scribble forms a unique
one.
I was scribbling with iron wire on tiles. I felt the same feeling as scribbling pen on paper.
