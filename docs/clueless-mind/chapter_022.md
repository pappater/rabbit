Frida Kahlo,
the one and only female artist portrait I hung in my living room has been admired by many
people for decades. She just got struck in the head when you see her for the first time. I have two
of them. The self portrait with the monkey, 1945 tells her inner emotion with a lot more
detailing. She is famous for her self portrait showcasing lifestyle, personal life, suffering, death
and so much detailing of her native towns.
This XXL monograph combines all of Kahlo's 152 paintings with rarely seen photographs, diary
pages, letters, and an illustrated biography.

Brita
Olofsdotter
(died 1569), was a Finnish soldier of the Swedish cavalry. She is the likely first confirmed female
soldier in Sweden, as well as the first confirmed Swedish example of the historical phenomena
of women impersonating men to gain access to professions barred to their gender.
Olofsdotter was from Finland and was the widow of Nils Simonsson. She dressed as a man and
enlisted during the Livonian War, where she served in the cavalry and was killed in battle. On
16 June 1569, John III of Sweden ordered Gabriel Christiensson to investigate the matter, and
gave the order that her remaining salary should be paid to her family.
The Livonian War (1558–1583) was fought for control of Old Livonia (in the territory of
present-day Estonia and Latvia), when the Tsardom of Russia faced a varying coalition of the
Dano-Norwegian Realm, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Union (later Commonwealth) of the
Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland.
