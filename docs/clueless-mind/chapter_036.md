Raj kumar,
a mid aged fella, wearing a blue shirt, was in the posture of taking a hitchhike, was standing at
the corner of Adhavan rice mill, which was painted yellow and it looks vintage. It was an off
road, filled with paddy field greenery on both sides and the dark clouds above; and raj kumar
started talking about his job as a prawns seller for half a year and another half as a masonry. The
green paddy fields, triggers something in him, where all of sudden he was telling about the
harvesting festival, on how people wake up early that day, harvest, worship god for making it
smooth, and how they celebrate this during pongal festival. He gave a rugged face when was
photographed but on request, some varied smiling face was posed; hiding his face and mouth;
but one can see the beauty in it.
The village has an old large banyan tree that was painted black inside and green out; it was
providing shade to localities, who were taking naps under it. There were a couple of old men,
admiring the drizzling on the sitting top of the brick block that was piled near the temple pond.
The pond filled with lilies and lotus and droplets of drizzle that intense to form rain. A V shaped
wood was fixed on the head, and another old man, who is deaf, was inquiring about the native
and stuff, but heard none and left.
This route connects short from Minjur to pulicat. Minjur is the dead end of chennai outer ring
road, filled mostly with the trucks and two wheeler. The highway, also filled with decomposed
dog body, that got hit a few days back, was still indicating her presence, even after gone to
heaven. The rooster was seen near to this scene, pecking the wet food on the streets, and all of
sudden flew up high, amidst a truck that was passing. It was such a kind of rooster that was
doing the same stuff to the passerby at the pulicat. They were a man and a decorated cow. He
used to bless people on getting paid. Making some positive comments to the cow, and the cow
nod YES, giving a positive beam to the payer. He walks all day and blesses people. That was his
work.
They were walking towards the Pazhaverkadu lighthouse, which was painted an alternative
white and ash colour. Crossing the lagoon was crowded with boats and small huts and people
gathered, playing cards in gangs, goli, spinning fishing net, getting the motor ready for fishing,
settling the grabbed fishes to the fish auction centre, which held crowds and shouting that
blurting numbers in random. The pathway filled with dead and decomposed fish that was extras
and not used for sales. There, it is a snake-like fish, in varied size, where some crows and birds
prey on them.
There was a shout and playing of school boys, inside the dutch cemetery, of king and queen and
minister, in marvellos structure, now ruined a little but the artwork and the writings still
remains, was not cared a bit by those littles. Our lady shrine was standing tall near the cemetery.

Painted white, bordered blue, and standing majestically, among the small hut of slum. The tiny
streets of the slum, all of sudden, show a building from 1950, where an old lady, converted it to a
convenience store, and doing her business there, was in focus on clearing her tooth set.
Near to the st. Antony church, a small lone room, not painted colours but with the algae, had a
doorless window, where a mid aged woman, hair trimmed, unclean, with staring eyes, blurting
some words, was gazing over the sun that was about the set. Her face painted golden with the
sun shine and after admiring it, on knowing people staring at her, realised and gradually moved
back and hid her face but haven’t stopped the murmuring. It gave a chill moment as the lone
building was installed on a deserted sea shore of golden sand that was parallel to ECR, that
parallel again with the back water. Some fishermen, on returning back from fishing, were in
discussion with the night plans of getting high. He is dark and his face hasn't smiled for long,
wears a black bracelet in his ankle and stuff. The town got only one functionable hotel, where
the owners were in discussion on improving their profit. Opposite, a little shop, which sells
only cool drinks, was in charge of a young boy, who was in conversation on the excess of the
stock that the deal had put on him last week.
The parallel ECR connects Ennore, travelling the off round for 20km. A young scholl fella in
white and white, got the lift and was on zig zagging the patched road. It was horrible as it goes
and the scenario of deserted barren sea shore and the back water on the right compensated for
the trouble. The route holds less people and villages but more of cows and was in wonder to
whom they all belong? Gradually the scenery gets updated where it shows adani port, L&T ship
building, North chennai thermal plant. The whole area is covered with the huge machines that
emit dark smokes but none care and riding the two wheels, rushing somewhere to the place
where they initially got out deciding it is a bore.
The old lady, around 100 plus kg, took the ride from the thermal power plant to Ennore. She
was in constant enquiry on the purpose and stuff and the bikes started to struggle due to the
overload. The body was titled to some angle that most of the space was occupied by her and it
raised a question on why the ride had been accepted in the first place.
Ennore express highway filled with trucks and only trucks. Parallely, the wave sounds shouting,
indicating its presence. A Huge cylinder-like pillar installed to reduce the intensity of the wave,
and the aftermath of hitting the pillar, fragments its droplet, and sprays the people and couples
who are in sync with the sea.
Some banner that holds the articles, that was published about the Atho street food, was in the
background, and the fella who was posing on the post was actually preparing Atho and was
serving people. It is at the beach road, backside of HSBC building and crowded fully with
people, dogs, beggars, old mens and womens and stuff. The nearby Atho stall was empty and
they didn't care either. The empty shop owner was in conversation with a mentally challenged
lady, who was already occupied in feeding hot strong tea to the stray dog, which she called her
julie, but failed at it after pouring it on the pedestrian. The empty shop owner started giving life

advice and philosophy to her. She was already sick of it as this was the same saying that she
hears from the empty shop owner all time.
