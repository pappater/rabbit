# Chapter 49

89
It was in
1984, that I read first when I was into the book reading phase. I have read a few books before but
considering it. It just invokes the thought that I haven't seen the work before and it lets me
explore more on that similar subject which turns me into a book worm. It eventually grew and
at some point I became so vexed from reading books from internet lists, so I just headed to an
old used book stall, bought some 50 books without reading the title, but was making sure it
should be a fiction which is not contemporary. But it was not what I expected. It seems to me
like a movie directory collection that I lost how the book felt. And after realising this, I just
randomly read NO LONGER HUMAN and it just invoked all the dead emotions buried deep
inside and just made me feel light how i felt when i read 1984. It was a disturbing story, a
biography actually, but apart from the dark stuff, most of the things I am able to relate to myself.
The narration is simple and unique. It is a short read that I read in two days.
