# Chapter 4

10
That day was
a nightmare. It was a moment when you hear a phone call and the conversation that is about to
be made seems to be an oracle from the future. If at all we had an intuition that the anecdote
that we have yet to receive from the future makes us frenzy, we may at least try not to
experience such an incident which led us to worry. But the truth is life doesn’t work like that. He
committed suicide was the sound that beamed from the microphone. That was around 10 in the
morning. Half past twelve, an uneasiness forms which inturn creates an uncertainty about the
incident.
He was a good fella.
By the evening, I got another phone call. From home, saying that I have to leave from work and
return back to home immediately. As some kind of flu epidemic is aghasting the entire world. I
decided to leave work and packed all my necessities. When I reached the bus station, some
people were wearing masks and some didn’t care. I took a bus to some place near the border of
the state as the bus service between the interstate is closed on that particular day. It was 2 at
midnight when I reached the border. Couldn't see any connecting buses to my state. I waited till
6 in the morning and I was informed by a driver that the state government had provided a bus
on that particular day and it was scheduled at 6:30. The journey is to cross two wildlife
sanctuaries, a tiger reserve, a hill station, a dam, a river rafting spot, a hot sun and a stereo
speaker that blurted classic medley.
It took 10 hours to cross all these moor. People I had witnessed on this trip don’t have any
knowledge on what is going on. They just did their regular work of going to the field, chit chat
on the street corners. Again I felt uncertain about what I was doing. But the bus was stopped at
the entrance of the state. It was bathed with bleach. Including our backpacks. Crossed the dam
and the river raft spot. Still the sun is tagging with us.
Dropped after crossing those moor. I looked like a gipsy. Still a 7 hour journey left to complete
this trip. I was the only one with the mask. Rest of the passengers looked at me as if I'm an alien
to them. Reached Home.
