## Planned Themes by Section

**Part I**: Burden, obligation, inherited guilt, the crushing weight of promises
**Part II**: Mercy, forgiveness, transformation, the possibility of redemption
**Part III** (Future): Grace, reconciliation, freedom within responsibility

## Key Symbolic Elements
- The debt ledger (burden of the past)
- Seasons (transformation and cycles)
- Letters and written promises (binding nature of words)
- Religious imagery (mercy, confession, redemption)
- Food and hospitality (community and care)

## Ending Vision (Subject to Change)
The novel should move toward a resolution that honors both justice and mercy, where characters find freedom not through escaping their obligations but through transformed understanding of what those obligations mean. Not a neat happy ending, but a truthful one that acknowledges ongoing struggle while affirming hope.
