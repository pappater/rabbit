# Moonbound Devotion

A contemporary fantasy romance novel in the style of popular Wattpad werewolf stories, featuring complete devotion, supernatural bonds, and passionate love.

## Synopsis

Lyra never believed in werewolves—until the night they raided her village. Captured and brought before Kael Nightshade, the feared Alpha King, she expects death. Instead, she discovers she's his fated mate, destined by the Moon Goddess herself.

Kael has waited over a century for his mate, never expecting to find her among humans. When the bond snaps into place with a silver-haired girl with defiant violet eyes, he knows he'll do anything to protect her, claim her, and make her his Luna Queen.

But their love is forbidden. The werewolf kingdom demands a werewolf queen. Enemies plot to tear them apart. War looms on the horizon. And Lyra herself carries a secret heritage that could change everything.

In a world where love transcends species and devotion knows no bounds, one human girl and one Alpha King will fight fate, tradition, and prejudice to prove that true mates are forever.
