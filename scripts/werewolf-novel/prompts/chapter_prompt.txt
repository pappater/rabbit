Write Chapter {chapter_num} in a contemporary fantasy romance voice that includes:

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Third-person limited POV (alternate between Lyra and Kael's perspectives for emotional depth)
- Rich sensory details emphasizing supernatural awareness (enhanced senses, mate bond feelings)
- Deep emotional interiority - show characters' thoughts, feelings, and internal conflicts
- Passionate romantic tension with appropriate buildup
- Natural dialogue that reveals personality and builds relationships
- Vivid descriptions of the fantasy world and werewolf abilities
- Balance action, romance, and character development

ROMANCE ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE:
- Electric awareness between fated mates (tingles, heightened senses, magnetic pull)
- Protective Alpha behavior (Kael's need to keep Lyra safe, possessiveness tempered by respect)
- Building trust and emotional intimacy alongside physical attraction
- Tender moments showing vulnerability
- Passionate scenes when appropriate to the story (sensual but tasteful, fade-to-black if explicit)
- Internal conflict about forbidden feelings
- Small gestures showing devotion and care

FANTASY ELEMENTS TO WEAVE IN:
- Werewolf abilities and limitations
- Pack dynamics and hierarchy

- World-building details naturally integrated
- Supernatural threats and conflicts

PACING AND STRUCTURE:
- Start with a hook that draws readers in
- Build tension throughout the chapter (romantic, dramatic, or both)
- Advance the plot according to the outline
- Maintain continuity with previous events
- End with a compelling moment - cliffhanger, revelation, emotional beat, or intimate scene
- Include at least one significant interaction between Lyra and Kael that develops their relationship

TONE:
- Passionate and emotionally intense
- Mix of danger/excitement and tender romance
- Hopeful despite obstacles
- Contemporary voice (accessible, engaging, not overly formal)
- Immersive and escapist

The chapter should be approximately 2,500-3,000 words to maintain the pacing of a 500+ page novel.

IMPORTANT: Write ONLY the chapter text. Begin directly with the narrative. Do not include any meta-commentary, notes, or explanations. The chapter should flow naturally as part of the ongoing story.

Chapter {chapter_num}: Begin now.
