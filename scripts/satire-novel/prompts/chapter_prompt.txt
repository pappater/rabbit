PREVIOUS STORY SUMMARY:
{previous_summary}

Write Chapter {chapter_num} in a satirical voice that includes:

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Third-person omniscient narrator with a wry, knowing voice
- Sharp observational humor that escalates absurdity while staying grounded in recognizable reality
- Rich descriptive details of bureaucratic environments (office spaces, forms, procedures)
- Internal monologue revealing Gordon's growing awareness of absurdity
- Clever dialogue featuring corporate jargon used both straight and satirically
- Balance comedy with genuine human moments
- Running gags and callbacks to earlier chapters

SATIRICAL ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE:
- Corporate buzzwords and business jargon (synergy, leverage, circle back, deep dive, etc.)
- Meaningless procedures and unnecessary complexity
- Meeting culture and email etiquette disasters
- Status symbols and office politics
- Contradictory directives and circular logic
- Innovation theater vs. actual innovation
- The gap between corporate values and reality

CHARACTER ELEMENTS:
- Gordon's evolving perspective (awareness growing gradually)
- Supporting characters' quirks and hidden depths
- Moments of genuine human connection amid the absurdity
- Small rebellions and acts of resistance
- Individual personalities shining through standardization

TONE:
- Satirical but not mean-spirited
- Absurdist escalation grounded in reality
- Witty and clever rather than sarcastic and bitter
- Humanist - ultimately about finding meaning and connection
- Kafkaesque meets Terry Pratchett
- Sharp social commentary wrapped in entertaining narrative

PACING AND STRUCTURE:
- Start with a hook that establishes the chapter's central absurdity
- Build the situation through accumulating details and escalations
- Include at least one memorable setpiece or comedic scenario
- Advance the plot according to the outline
- Maintain continuity with previous events and running gags
- End with either a punchline, revelation, or moment of genuine emotion
- Weave in recurring elements (coffee machine, missing staplers, Steve from IT, etc.)

HUMOR TECHNIQUES:
- Juxtaposition of serious tone describing ridiculous situations
- Understated reactions to absurd events
- Corporate jargon taken to logical extremes
- Literal interpretations of metaphors
- Bureaucratic procedures applied to trivial matters
- Characters completely missing the obvious
- Deadpan delivery of ridiculous lines

BALANCE:
While satirical and comedic, include moments of:
- Genuine human connection between characters
- Small victories and meaningful gestures
- Recognition of real human needs beneath the absurdity
- Hope and resilience amid dysfunction

The chapter should be approximately 1,600-2,000 words to maintain pacing suitable for a 100-page novel (approximately 4 pages per chapter).

IMPORTANT: Write ONLY the chapter text. Begin directly with the narrative. Do not include any meta-commentary, notes, or explanations. The chapter should read as a seamless continuation of the story, maintaining the satirical tone while advancing plot and character development.

Chapter {chapter_num}: Begin now.
