PREVIOUS STORY SUMMARY:

Write Chapter {chapter_num} in the style of Camus' existentialist prose:
- First-person present tense narration for immediacy and directness
- Simple, declarative sentences with minimal embellishment
- Focus on physical sensations: heat, light, taste, sound, touch
- Emotional detachment - the narrator observes but doesn't interpret feelings
- Attention to mundane details with the same weight as significant events
- No psychological explanations or introspection about why the narrator feels (or doesn't feel) certain ways
- Let the absurdity of situations emerge naturally from honest description
- Sparse dialogue that reveals character through what is said plainly
- The narrator is radically honest, even when that honesty is socially inappropriate
- Nature (sun, sea, sky) as indifferent, powerful forces

Stylistic guidelines:
- Short to medium paragraphs
- Economical prose - no wasted words
- Concrete over abstract language
- Show through sensory detail rather than tell through interpretation
- The narrator reports events without moral judgment
- Occasional longer philosophical passages only in later chapters as the narrator gains clarity
- Maintain emotional flatness even during dramatic events
- Let the reader feel the emotions the narrator cannot or does not

The chapter should be approximately 2000-3000 words, advance the plot according to the outline, maintain continuity with previous events, and end naturally, without forcing dramatic tension.

Write only the chapter text, without any meta-commentary or notes. Begin directly with the narrative in first-person present tense.
