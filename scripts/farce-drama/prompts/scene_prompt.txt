Write Act {act_num}, Scene {scene_num} as a theatrical farce:
- Use physical comedy, mistaken identities, absurd situations, and rapid-fire dialogue
- Include stage directions in italics to indicate character movements, expressions, and physical comedy
- Create exaggerated characters and situations that satirize social conventions and pretensions
- Build comedic timing through misunderstandings, coincidences, and escalating chaos
- Use witty dialogue with wordplay, puns, and comedic timing
- Include moments of farcical confusion where characters talk past each other
- Create visual comedy opportunities through props, costumes, or physical gags
- Maintain theatrical energy with entrances, exits, and dramatic reveals
- Build to a comedic crescendo or absurd situation by the scene's end

The scene should be approximately 1,500-2,500 words, formatted as a theatrical script with:
- CHARACTER NAMES in CAPS before dialogue
- Stage directions in [brackets] or italics
- Scene setting description at the beginning

Advance the plot according to the outline, maintain continuity with previous scenes, and end with either a comedic cliffhanger, a moment of chaos, or a transition that propels the action forward.

Write only the scene text in theatrical script format, without any meta-commentary. Begin with the scene setting.
